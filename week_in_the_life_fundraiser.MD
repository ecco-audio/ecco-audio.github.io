Here’s a full blueprint for **“A Week in the Life of a Fundraiser”** built to match the vibe/structure of your Capital Markets 101 primer (sections, cards, timelines, etc.).

I’ll do two things:

1. **Slide-by-slide outline** you can drop into your existing HTML template.
2. **Deep persona write‑ups** (mental, emotional, aspirational, tasks, interactions, data processing, good/bad moments).

---

## 1. Deck Outline

### Slide 1 – Title

**Section pill:** Osmosis Team Primer
**Headline:**

> A Week in the Life of a Fundraiser
> **Inside a Multi‑Asset Platform**

**Subtext:**
“A human view of the people we sell to: what their weeks look like, what they worry about, and where Osmosis actually helps.”

---

### Slide 2 – Why This Week Matters

**Section pill:** Start Here
**Header:** Why Study Their Week?

Body (bullets):

* Fundraising isn’t abstract. It’s calendars, messy CRMs, delayed decks, and anxious LPs.
* If we understand their actual week, we understand:

  * When they feel pressure
  * When they look for help
  * When they say “yes” or “no” to new tools
* Our goal: **empathy → credibility → better product and sales.**

Callout:

> “We don’t sell to ‘fundraisers’. We sell to *Mac in London on a Tuesday night*, trying to prep for a consultant meeting on 3 hours of sleep.”

---

### Slide 3 – The Firm Context: Multi‑Asset Manager

**Section pill:** The Environment
**Header:** The Multi‑Asset Platform They Live In

Two‑column card layout:

* **Left: “The Platform”**

  * PE, Private Credit, Real Estate, Infrastructure, maybe Public/Hybrid strategies
  * Multiple funds in market at once (Flagship PE V, Credit III, Infra II, a perpetual product)
  * Global LP base: pensions, SWFs, endowments, family offices, wealth channel
* **Right: “What This Means for Fundraising”**

  * Constant fundraising somewhere on the platform
  * Juggling **competing internal constituencies** (each PM thinks their strategy should go first)
  * Heavy dependence on **consultants, OCIOs, and platforms** to scale access

Insight strip at bottom:

> “Fundraising at a platform = less ‘one big fund every few years’ and more **portfolio management of relationships** across products.”

---

### Slide 4 – Meet the Three Personas

**Section pill:** The Humans
**Header:** Three People We Care About

Three cards:

1. **Mac – Capital Formation Associate (Early Career)**

   * MD / Partner leading Capital Formation
   * Feels like: *“Quarterback + Chief Therapist + Chief Storyteller.”*
   * Lives in: pipeline meetings, LP roadshows, PM/partner debates

3. **COO – Platform Operations Executive**

   * Owns ops + tech + resourcing for fundraising/IR
   * Feels like: *“I have 20 fires and 2 buckets of water.”*

---

### Slide 10 – Inside Mac’s Head, Day by Day

**Section pill:** Mental & Emotional
**Header:** Mac – What the Week *Feels* Like

For each day, 1–2 bullets for mental state and emotions:

* **Monday:**

  * Mental: “If I don’t get the pipeline right now, the whole week is garbage.”
  * Emotional: Overloaded but motivated; wants to impress in internal pipeline meeting.
* **Tuesday:**

  * Mental: “I must know more about this LP than they expect.”
  * Emotional: Slight anxiety before big LP meetings; relief when senior MD says “Great prep.”
* **Wednesday:**

  * Mental: “Too much content, not enough time.” (conferences, panels, news)
  * Emotional: Frustration at manual note‑taking and fear of missing critical intel.
* **Thursday:**

  * Mental: “Consultants are kingmakers – I can’t screw up this touchpoint.”
  * Emotional: High stakes; nervous if they’re going into a meeting with half‑baked intel.
* **Friday:**

  * Mental: “Did I drop any balls?” (checklist thinking)
  * Emotional: Tension until reporting is done; then mild decompression.

---

### Slide 11 – Mac’s Tasks, Problems, Data Flows

**Section pill:** Jobs to Be Done
**Header:** Mac – What They Actually Do All Week

**Tasks**

* Build and update LP target lists (by strategy, region, ticket size)
* Prep **one‑pagers and meeting packs** customized to each allocator
* Update CRM: contacts, meeting notes, next steps, probability, dollar size
* Coordinate with PMs/strategy leads to get latest performance, pipeline, case studies
* Track conference attendance; note who said what on stage or in side conversations
* Manage inbound: “We’d like to learn more about your private credit product”

**Problems They’re Trying to Solve**

* “Are we talking to the right LPs at the right time with the right story?”
* “How do I summarize what this LP cares about without reading everything they’ve ever said?”
* “How do I avoid asking stupid questions that were already answered in public?”
* “How can I keep the pipeline real (not fantasy numbers) without being the bad guy?”

**How Mac Processes Data Today**

* Inputs:

  * Conference agendas & recordings (if they get them)
  * Consultant reports, newsletters
  * LP public statements, RFPs, earnings calls for insurance/asset owners
  * Internal spreadsheets & performance reports
* Processing:

  * Manual Google/Preqin/website search before each meeting
  * Quick scan of PDFs; copying snippets into notes
  * Mental tagging: “This LP is big into sustainable infra,” “This one hates mega funds.”
* Output:

  * 1–2 page **LP brief**: AUM, mandate, historical relationship, key quotes, hot buttons
  * CRM entries with rough tags (“infra increase”, “moving into private credit”)

**What Separates a High‑Performing Mac from Peers**

* Builds **reusable knowledge** (shared LP profiles, smart tagging) vs one‑off notes
* Anticipates questions from senior MDs *before* they ask
* Uses data to push back respectfully: “This LP’s CIO has said they’re at capacity in buyout—let’s lead with infra.”
* Crafts crisp, specific meeting briefs rather than dumping raw info

---

### Slide 12 – Mac: Positive vs Negative Interactions

**Section pill:** Moments That Matter
**Header:** Mac – When the Job Feels Great vs Terrible

**Positive**

* Consultant says in a meeting: “You clearly did your homework on our client’s priorities.”
* Head of FR forwards Mac’s prep note to the CIO with “Best LP prep I’ve seen.”
* LP feedback: “Loved how tailored your materials were – you really understand our program.”

**Negative**

* Senior MD asks, “Why didn’t you flag that this LP is reducing PE?” after they mention it on a panel last month.
* LP says, “We covered this exact question at [big conference] – didn’t anyone listen?”
* Internal scramble the night before a big consultant pitch because no one can find what that consultant has said publicly about the strategy.

**Where Osmosis Shows Up for Mac**

* Search for allocator name → see **recent panels, interviews, key quotes**
* Auto‑generated LP brief that Mac can copy into their prep doc
* Alerts when a target LP or consultant mentions relevant strategies/competitors

---

### Slide 13 – Head of Fundraising: The Week at a Glance

**Section pill:** Weekly Rhythm
**Header:** Head of Fundraising – The Orchestrator’s Week

Table layout similar to Mac’s, but at a higher altitude:

* **Monday**

  * Internal pipeline review: by product, region, owner
  * Priority re‑allocation (who travels where, which LPs get senior time)
* **Tuesday**

  * LP/consultant meetings (often stacked back‑to‑back, in person or virtual)
  * Quick internal debriefs: “Is this real? What’s next step?”
* **Wednesday**

  * Product alignment: meetings with PMs and marketing to refine narrative
  * Strategy on problem accounts: challenged LPs, weak relationships, stuck processes
* **Thursday**

  * Investor roadshow days; travel heavy
  * Dinners with key LPs / consultants
* **Friday**

  * Review of week’s activity with COO/CIO/CEO
  * Progress vs fundraising targets; identify risks for the quarter

---

### Slide 14 – Inside the Head of Fundraising

**Section pill:** Mental & Emotional
**Header:** The Head of Fundraising – What’s Going On Internally

**Mental Model Across the Week**

* Constant prioritization: “Which conversations move the needle?”
* Running a mental P&L: “If we don’t hit first close on Credit III, the whole platform’s story suffers.”
* Thinking in **portfolios of LPs**:

  * Re‑ups (defensive)
  * Strategic new logos (offensive)
  * Consultants/OCIOs (multipliers)

**Emotional Landscape**

* High baseline stress: big fundraising targets, public perception, internal politics
* Pride when:

  * They secure a cornerstone commitment from a marquee LP
  * They see the firm included on consultant “buy lists”
* Anxiety when:

  * A major LP goes silent
  * A consultant hints that the firm is slipping relative to peers
* Aspirational:

  * Wants to be perceived as a *strategic voice*, not just “sales”
  * Wants to prove the platform can regularly raise in any environment

---

### Slide 15 – Head of Fundraising: Problems, Motivations, Differentiators

**Section pill:** Jobs to Be Done
**Header:** What They’re Solving for (Beyond Just “More AUM”)

**Key Problems**

* “Where is allocators’ **actual demand** moving? Are we positioned there?”
* “Are we **missing big shifts** in consultant/OCIO views until it’s too late?”
* “How do we coordinate PMs who all want top billing with LPs?”
* “How do we **avoid bad surprises** in rooms with CIOs and boards?”

**Emotional Motivations**

* Avoiding embarrassment in front of LPs (“We hadn’t seen your recent comments on evergreen products…”)
* Protecting the firm’s reputation as “tier one” vs falling into “me‑too manager” territory
* Building a legacy platform that’s seen as **thoughtful, strategic, and allocator‑aligned**

**What Separates the Best Heads of FR from the Pack**

* They walk into meetings with **specific, recent knowledge** of LP priorities and constraints
* They **tailor the story** to each allocator’s world (regulatory, board, politics)
* They **connect dots across public statements**, consultant reports, and their own conversations
* They use data to drive internal alignment: “Consultants are clearly rotating into private credit; we should bring that product forward.”

**How They Process Data Today**

* Inputs:

  * Summary decks from team (Mac & co.)
  * Consultant memos, LP RFPs, board minutes (when shared)
  * Market commentary, Preqin/PitchBook, conference attendance
* Processing:

  * Scanning executive summaries, relying heavily on **narrative from trusted lieutenants**
  * Mental pattern recognition: “We’re hearing the same three themes across LPs.”
* Gaps:

  * Relies on anecdotes (“I heard at a conference…”) instead of structured view of allocator remarks
  * Limited ability to **search across spoken content** quickly

**Osmosis Fit**

* Executive‑level dashboards:

  * “Here’s what top 50 target LPs + 10 key consultants said about our strategies this quarter.”
* Meeting prep snapshots:

  * 1‑page view used before each CIO/consultant meeting to ensure there are **no blind spots**

---

### Slide 16 – COO: The Week at a Glance

**Section pill:** Weekly Rhythm
**Header:** COO – Running the Machine

**Typical Week**

* **Monday**

  * Review ops metrics: response times, reporting SLAs, data quality of pipeline
  * Budget and headcount check‑ins
* **Tuesday**

  * Vendor/tech discussions (CRMs, data providers, marketing tools)
  * Risk/compliance review: marketing review backlog, regulatory issues
* **Wednesday**

  * Strategic projects: new product launches, entry into new regions or channels
  * Cross‑functional working groups (IT, legal, fundraising, IR)
* **Thursday**

  * Meetings with product heads / CIO on how fundraising capabilities align with strategy roadmap
  * Address bottlenecks flagged by Head of FR (“We’re missing analytics on X”)
* **Friday**

  * Reporting to CEO/Board: how scalable and institutional the platform looks
  * Prioritization for following week, trade‑offs on investments

---

### Slide 17 – COO: Problems, Motivations, Differentiators

**Section pill:** Jobs to Be Done
**Header:** COO – What Keeps Them Up at Night

**Key Problems**

* “We’re running a multi‑billion multi‑strategy platform on **glorified spreadsheets and tribal knowledge**.”
* “Every new tool creates change‑management drag and integration pain.”
* “How do I give commercial teams **leverage** without creating more operational/tech debt?”

**Emotional Motivations**

* Wants to be the person who “professionalized” the platform
* Fears:

  * A major operational failure that makes them look unserious to LPs
  * Tech spend perceived as wasteful, not ROI‑positive
* Pride when:

  * They can show clear process improvements (less time to prep, fewer errors)
  * LPs comment: “Your reporting and communications are best‑in‑class.”

**What Separates the Best COOs**

* They think in **systems**:

  * Data flows between marketing → capital formation → IR → performance reporting
  * Clear definitions: what is a “qualified opportunity”, “stage”, “coverage owner”
* They treat vendor selection like building a **coherent stack**, not random point solutions
* They push for **adoption** and behavior change, not just buying tools

**How They Process Data Today**

* Inputs:

  * Dashboards from CRM/BI tools (often laggy, partial)
  * Feedback from Head of FR, IR, PMs
  * LP satisfaction surveys or anecdotal feedback
* Processing:

  * Looking for patterns: “We’re slow at follow‑up after conferences”, “Our LP prep is inconsistent.”
  * Root‑cause analysis of pipeline gaps and lost allocations
* Gaps:

  * Poor visibility into **qualitative context** driving LP behavior (board politics, public statements)
  * Hard to measure the **quality** of meetings vs just the quantity

**Osmosis Fit**

* A **shared, structured source** of allocator/consultant intelligence feeding CRM/BI
* Ability to show:

  * “With Osmosis, meeting prep time dropped by X% and win rates on ‘warm’ targets improved by Y%.”

---

### Slide 18 – Positive vs Negative Moments (All Personas)

**Section pill:** Moments That Matter
**Header:** What a Good Week vs Bad Week Looks Like

Two columns: **Positive Week** vs **Negative Week**, with bullets across personas.

**Positive Week**

* Mac:

  * Preps LP briefs using rich, recent allocator quotes; internal team feels “armed.”
* Head of FR:

  * Spots a thematic shift early (“LPs tilting into private credit”) and pivots messaging; wins a flagship mandate.
* COO:

  * Sees clean, consistent data across systems; hears unsolicited praise from LPs about professionalism.

**Negative Week**

* Mac:

  * Scrambles to find who said what; gets blamed for missing a critical LP comment in a public forum.
* Head of FR:

  * Walks into a meeting where the LP cites a recent consultant panel; the team clearly hasn’t seen it.
* COO:

  * Realizes the firm is making strategic fundraising decisions on **gut feel** and scattered notes.

---

### Slide 19 – How They Process Information vs How Osmosis Helps

**Section pill:** Data & Decisions
**Header:** From Noise to Signal

Two‑column comparison table:

* **Today**

  * Conference content is scattered and ephemeral
  * LP/consultant spoken remarks live in individual notebooks or memory
  * Prep = frantic last‑minute Googling + asking around internally
  * Data in CRM is mostly **structured metadata**, not rich context
* **With Osmosis**

  * Spoken LP & consultant content is **captured, searchable, tagged**
  * Each persona gets the slice they need:

    * Mac: meeting‑level prep notes
    * Head of FR: thematic trend views across allocators
    * COO: metrics on usage, prep efficiency, coverage quality
  * Fundraising decisions are based on an **institutionalized memory** of allocator behavior

---

### Slide 20 – Bringing It Together

**Section pill:** Bringing It Together
**Header:** The Story in 30 Seconds

Narrative you can mirror from your current “Summary” slide, but persona‑focused:

* A multi‑asset manager’s fundraising machine is powered by **Mac**, the **Head of FR**, and the **COO**.
* They are all trying to solve the same problem from different angles:

  > “Get the right capital from the right allocators on the right terms, without breaking the machine.”
* They are constrained by:

  * Fragmented information
  * Heavy manual prep
  * Fear of missing allocator/consultant signals
* Osmosis gives each of them a **superpower**:

  * Mac: “I always know what this LP/consultant has said.”
  * Head of FR: “I can see where the puck is going.”
  * COO: “I can institutionalize allocator intelligence, not just hope the right person remembers.”

---

## 2. Deep Persona Reference (Copy‑Paste Material)

Below is raw, “verbose” reference you can mine for speaker notes, tooltips, or expanded text on slides.

---

### Mac – Capital Formation Associate (Multi‑Asset Manager)

**Identity & Context**

* Early career, smart, ambitious, usually background in banking/consulting or straight from undergrad with a finance focus.
* Sees this role as a **launchpad** – either to become a senior fundraiser, product specialist, or even jump to the investing side.

**Mental World**

* Constant multitasking: email, CRM, Slack/Teams, Excel, decks, Zoom.
* Thinks in lists and queues (“What’s due today? What’s overdue?”).
* Tries to build a mental map of:

  * Which LPs care about which strategies
  * Where each LP sits in the pipeline
  * Who internally owns which relationship

**Emotional World**

* Positive emotions:

  * Pride when a senior MD clearly relies on their prep
  * Satisfaction from clean, updated pipeline and good feedback
* Negative emotions:

  * Anxiety about hidden mistakes
  * Feeling invisible (“I did all this work but only the MD gets credit in the room”)
  * Overwhelm from information overload

**Aspirations**

* Short‑term:

  * Be “the person” for a region/strategy (e.g., “If you’re doing anything with UK pensions in credit, you go to Mac.”)
* Long‑term:

  * Career progression, more direct LP coverage
  * Being in the room as a *peer* with CIOs, not just as note‑taker

**Key Internal Relationships**

* **Head of FR & senior MDs** – main “clients”; they define priorities, goals
* **IR team** – they share LP info and follow‑up responsibilities
* **Product/strategy leads** – needed for nuanced answers and case studies
* **Marketing** – for decks, factsheets, RFP content
* **Legal/Compliance** – for approvals on language, data usage

**Key External Touchpoints**

* **LPs** – often not primary voice, but on calls handling logistics and occasional clarifications
* **Consultants/OCIOs** – scheduling, follow‑up, sending materials
* **Conference organizers** – passes, speaking slots, follow‑up lists

**Positive Interaction Example**

* Before a big meeting with a European pension:

  * Mac uses Osmosis to pull recent remarks of that pension’s CIO and head of alternatives about evergreen vs closed‑end funds and their climate goals.
  * They summarize this into a tight brief:

    * “They’re cautious on evergreen real estate due to gating issues. They’re increasing infra exposure, particularly energy transition.”
  * In the meeting, the Head of FR opens with:

    * “We heard your team talk about X and Y recently…”
  * LP reacts positively: “You’ve clearly been paying attention.”
  * After the meeting, Head of FR says: “Great brief, this shaped the whole conversation.”

**Negative Interaction Example**

* Consultant references comments they made on a panel:

  * “As we said at ILPA last month, we’re concerned about mega‑fund sizing in buyout.”
  * The team doesn’t know what exactly was said; Mac never saw any transcript or recording.
  * They pitch a mega‑fund increase anyway. The consultant’s body language turns cold.
  * After, the Head of FR: “We should have known this. Why didn’t we?” Mac feels at fault.

---

### Head of Fundraising – Multi‑Asset Manager

**Identity & Context**

* Senior, often ex‑banker / placement agent / seasoned IR pro.
* Politically sensitive role: sits between CEO/CIO, PMs, COOs, and the entire LP universe.

**Mental World**

* Very pipeline‑oriented:

  * “What’s the path to target for each product?”
  * “Where are we off pace and why?”
* Constantly triaging:

  * Whose travel is worth it? Which conferences matter? Which LPs are tire‑kickers vs real?
* Strategic:

  * Balancing flagship funds vs niche strategies
  * Thinking about vintage timing vs macro environment

**Emotional World**

* Feels pressure from:

  * CEO/Board expectations and public AUM growth targets
  * Internal politics with PMs wanting more capital for their strategies
* Gets energy from:

  * Momentum: oversubscribed funds, repeat LP commitments
  * Being early to shifts (“we leaned into private credit while others hesitated”)

**Aspirations**

* Build a reputation for the firm as an **elite capital raiser** – efficient, thoughtful, aligned with LPs
* Personally:

  * Move from being seen as “sales” to “strategic leader”
  * Have a seat in firm‑wide capital allocation and product roadmap decisions

**Internal Relationships**

* **CEO/CIO/Strategy Heads** – alignment on product, timing, messaging
* **COO** – on resources, tools, process
* **IR & Associates** – execution muscle
* **Marketing** – quality of story, materials

**External Relationships**

* **Key LP CIOs & heads of alts** – long‑term anchor relationships
* **Consultants & OCIOs** – gatekeepers, multipliers
* **Placement agents, wealth platforms** – channel leverage

**Positive Interaction Example**

* Consultant roundtable:

  * They’ve reviewed what consultants have said publicly about infra vs private credit in last 6 months (with Osmosis).
  * They go into the roundtable and say:

    * “We’ve heard a lot of concern from your peers about X and Y; here’s how our platform is addressing that.”
  * Consultant perceives them as knowledgeable and aligned: “You’re clearly on top of allocator sentiment.”
  * Weeks later, the consultant includes them on a recommended list for multiple pensions.

**Negative Interaction Example**

* Board meeting with a sovereign wealth fund:

  * Board member references a recent public hearing where the SWF criticized fee structures on evergreen products.
  * Head of FR and CIO haven’t seen the hearing; they launch into standard pitch.
  * Afterwards, internal debrief:

    * “We looked tone‑deaf. They clearly flagged this; why didn’t we adjust our narrative?”

---

### COO – Multi‑Asset Platform

**Identity & Context**

* Senior operator, often ex‑CFO/COO or senior ops head from another platform.
* Cares about **process, risk, and scalability** as much as about fundraising success.

**Mental World**

* Sees the firm as a network of processes and systems:

  * Investor onboarding, KYC/AML
  * Marketing approvals
  * IR/fundraising workflows
  * Fund accounting, reporting
* Always asking:

  * “What breaks at 2x our size?”
  * “Where is data inconsistent or untrusted?”
  * “What is we are audited on this?”

**Emotional World**

* Pride in:

  * Clean audits, smooth LP experience, on‑time reporting
  * Enabling commercial teams to move faster while staying controlled
* Anxiety around:

  * Shadow systems (Excel hell, rogue trackers)
  * Over‑reliance on individual memory
  * Fragmented tech stack with poor integration

**Aspirations**

* Build an operating model that:

  * Impresses global LPs
  * supports new strategies/channels without proportional headcount increases
* Be seen as essential strategic partner, not “back office”

**Internal Relationships**

* **CEO, CFO** – budget, strategy, risk
* **Head of FR & IR** – needs, pain points, process issues
* **IT/Data, Legal/Compliance, HR** – implementation and governance

**External Relationships**

* **Vendors** – CRM, data providers, analytics, collaboration tools
* **Service providers** – administrators, legal, consultants on ops
* **Sometimes LPs** – when there’s major process or reporting discussions

**Positive Interaction Example**

* COO can point to metrics:

  * “Our LP prep time per meeting is down 40%, our follow‑up SLAs improved by 30%.”
* When CEO asks “how do we know we’re not missing key signals from top LPs?”, the COO can show:

  * A system (Osmosis + CRM/BI integration) with coverage stats and usage metrics.

**Negative Interaction Example**

* CEO hears, from a CIO friend, that the firm looked unprepared in a public meeting.
* Investigating, COO discovers:

  * No centralized record of the LP’s past comments, panels, or hearings
  * Prep depended entirely on one associate’s manual Google search.
* COO realizes: “We don’t have a system for allocator intelligence; we have a collection of anecdotes.”
