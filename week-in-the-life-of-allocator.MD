Here we go 🙌 — full allocator counterpart to your fundraiser doc, using:

* **Maria Alvarez** – Head of Infrastructure, Public Pension
* **Daniel Cho** – Investment Associate, University Endowment
* **Sarah McIntyre** – CIO, Family Office

I’ll mirror the *structure and vibe* of your Capital Markets 101 primer so this can become a sibling deck. 

---

## 1. Deck Outline – “A Week in the Life of an Allocator”

You can imagine these as slides with the same section-pills, headers, cards, and timelines you used in the primer.

---

### Slide 1 – Title

**Section pill:** Osmosis Team Primer
**Headline:**

> A Week in the Life of an Allocator
> **How They Think, Decide, and Speak**

Subtext:

> A human look at the people on the other side of the table—what their weeks actually look like, what they worry about, and how they process information.

---

### Slide 2 – Why Do We Care About Allocators’ Weeks?

**Section pill:** Start Here
**Header:** Why Study Allocators Like This?

Bullets:

* Asset managers are our direct customers.
* **Allocators are *their* customers.**
* To be credible with GPs, we need a *felt sense* of:

  * What a Head of Infrastructure is juggling at a public plan
  * How an endowment associate actually consumes content
  * How a CIO at a family office makes decisions

Callout:

> If we can see the world the way allocators do, we can help GPs show up smarter, more aligned, and less generic.

---

### Slide 3 – The Three Allocator Personas

---

### Slide 8 – Maria’s Tasks, Problems & Data Flows

**Section pill:** Jobs to Be Done
**Header:** Maria – What She Actually Does All Week

**Core Tasks**

* Maintain / refine infra manager pipeline (by subsector, risk, geography).

* Lead or contribute to investment memos and IC materials.
* Monitor performance and risk for existing infra managers.
* Engage with ESG / governance teams on project-level concerns.
* Prepare for and participate in committee / board meetings and public sessions.
* Attend and sometimes **speak at industry events** (ILPA, infrastructure conferences).

**Problems She’s Trying to Solve**

* “Can I justify this manager/strategy to a skeptical board in public?”
* “Are we being compensated for the political and headline risk we’re taking?”
* “Are we ahead of or behind our peers on energy transition, digital infra, etc.?”
* “Are our GPs aligned on fees, risk sharing, downside protection?”

**How Maria Processes Information**

* Inputs:

  * Consultant reports & recommendations
  * GP pitch decks, DDQs, side letters
  * Internal risk and performance dashboards
  * Public hearings, peer plan commentaries, regulatory actions
  * Conference panel notes, industry publications

* Processing:

  * Filters everything through **governance and defensibility**:

    * “Would this look sensible in a transcript?”
  * Synthesizes into:

    * Investment memos with clear risk sections
    * Talking points and Q&A prep for the IC/board

* Outputs:

  * Final recommendations: “Approve/Decline/Watchlist” for GPs
  * Portfolio-level guidance: “Tilt to X, reduce Y, caution on Z”

**What Separates Maria from Weaker Peers**

* She doesn’t just parrot consultants; she **interrogates** them.
* She triangulates GP marketing with:

  * Other plans’ remarks
  * Public hearings, regulatory documents
  * Her own historical experience
* She builds a coherent **infra narrative** for the plan:

  * “We are overweight energy transition, underweight core/core-plus roads for these reasons…”

---

### Slide 9 – Maria’s Interactions: Internal & External

**Section pill:** Relationships
**Header:** Maria – Who She’s Dancing With

**Internal**

* CIO: strategic direction, risk appetite, pacing.
* Other asset class heads: ensure infra fits overall portfolio risk.
* Risk, ESG, legal, compliance: structuring & constraints.
* Staff analysts: data pulls, model updates, memo drafting.
* Board / Investment Committee: formal presentations, Q&A.

**External**

* Consultants (e.g., Aon, Meketa, Mercer): evaluations, peer data, pacing guidance.
* GPs: existing managers and new strategies.
* Other public plans: peer intel, best practices, co-invest opportunities.
* Industry bodies: ILPA, infra associations, working groups.
* Sometimes media / public forums.

---

### Slide 10 – Maria: Positive vs Negative Moments

**Section pill:** Moments That Matter
**Header:** Maria – When Her Job Feels Great vs Terrible

**Positive Moments**

* An IC session where:

  * She fields tough questions smoothly because she’s deeply prepared.
  * A skeptical board member says, “This was very thorough and clearly thought through.”
* A consultant panel where:

  * Peer plans and consultants validate her chosen themes (e.g., data centers, regulated utilities).
* A successful GP relationship:

  * A manager she backed early proves out, and peers ask how she underwrote that risk.

**Negative Moments**

* Public criticism:

  * A newspaper headline or hearing where a project she approved gets dragged as “too risky” or “politically tone-deaf.”
* “Surprise” revelations:

  * A GP’s strategy drift or governance failure comes out in the press or at a conference before she hears it directly.
* Time wasted:

  * Sitting through GP pitches that clearly don’t fit policy or risk appetite because the GP didn’t do basic homework.

**Where Osmosis Helps Maria**

* **Context for defensibility:**

  * Before an IC/board meeting: pull what other plans, regulators, and consultants have said publicly about similar assets/strategies.
* **Early warning:**

  * Alerts when a current or potential GP is mentioned in hearings, media panels, or consultant roundtables.
* **Peer benchmarking:**

  * “Here’s how 5 other large public plans talked about energy transition or user-fee risk in the last 12 months.”

## Persona 2 – Daniel Cho

**Investment Associate, University Endowment**

---

### Slide 11 – Persona Snapshot: Daniel

**Section pill:** Persona Deep Dive
**Header:** Daniel – Investment Associate, Endowment

**Role & Scope**

* Covers multiple asset classes (often a mix of PE, VC, and real assets) for a ~$5B endowment.
* First-pass filter for managers.
* Writes memos that heavily drive CIO decisions.

**Mental Model**

* “My job is to **separate signal from noise** and turn conversations into clear, actionable recommendations.”
* “I’m judged on the quality of my thinking, not how many meetings I take.”

**Emotional Drivers**

* Pride in:

  * Writing tightly reasoned memos the CIO compliments or circulates.
  * Spotting risks or structural flaws others miss.
* Fear of:

  * Missing material issues (key-person risk, strategy drift, hidden leverage).
  * Being perceived as sloppy or overly “GP-friendly.”

**Aspirations**

* Short-term: promotion to Investment Officer / VP.
* Long-term: become a **generalist PM** or eventually CIO at an allocator or move to a high-quality GP.

---

### Slide 14 – Daniel’s Tasks, Problems & Data Flows

**Section pill:** Jobs to Be Done
**Header:** Daniel – What He Actually Does All Week

**Core Tasks**

* Screening managers: deciding who gets a second meeting and who doesn’t.
* Conducting reference checks (speaking to other LPs, ex-colleagues, company CEOs).
* Reading:

  * GP decks, DDQs, quarterly letters, legal docs.
  * Peer allocator commentary, consultant notes, conference transcripts.
* Building financial and performance models.
* Drafting and revising investment memos.
* Tracking portfolio and pacing vs policy targets.

**Problems He’s Trying to Solve**

* “Which managers are truly differentiated vs marketing nicely?”
* “Do we really need *another* infra/credit/VC fund in this sleeve?”
* “Are we overweight certain risks across managers (e.g., leverage, cyclicality, geography)?”
* “Am I missing any red flags that will make us look foolish in 3–5 years?”

**How Daniel Processes Information**

* Inputs:

  * Raw: decks, DDQs, legal docs.
  * Contextual: conference panels, podcasts, allocator roundtables, consultant views.
  * Peer and historical data: other memos, past decisions, benchmarking.

* Processing:

  * Convert diffuse qualitative inputs into structured mental buckets:

    * Team, Strategy, Track Record, Edge, Risks, LP Fit.
  * Uses quotes from allocators, consultants, and GPs as **evidence** in memos:

    * “As X said at Y conference…”
  * Heavy reliance on note-taking and tagging to avoid re-reading everything.

* Outputs:

  * Short-list recommendations
  * Detailed memos with:

    * Thesis, reservations, scenario analysis, recommendation (Approve/Decline/Monitor)

**What Separates Top-Tier Daniels from Others**

* Builds a **library of thematic knowledge** (e.g., infra subsectors, credit structures) and keeps it updated.
* Cross-references what *allocators & consultants* say with what GPs claim.
* Is willing to recommend “No” convincingly, not just “Sure, why not.”

---

### Slide 15 – Daniel’s Relationships & Interactions

**Section pill:** Relationships
**Header:** Daniel – Who He Works With

**Internal**

* CIO: primary audience for memos and debates.
* Senior PMs: asset-class leads who rely on his prep and analysis.
* Ops / Risk: help with portfolio impact, liquidity, and constraints.
* Other associates: informal knowledge-sharing (“Have you seen this GP in another context?”).

**External**

* GPs:

  * Regular calls, on-site visits, conference meetings.
* Other allocators / peers:

  * Peer benchmarking, off-the-record references.
* Consultants / data providers:

  * Sometimes for cross-checks or specialized data.

---

### Slide 16 – Daniel: Positive vs Negative Moments

**Section pill:** Moments That Matter
**Header:** Daniel – What a Great vs Terrible Week Looks Like

**Positive Moments**

* Memo lands well:

  * CIO praises his clarity.
  * Committee discussion mirrors his framing and conclusions.
* Detective win:

  * He finds a meaningful piece of public commentary or panel remark that reveals:

    * a GP’s inconsistency, or
    * a key strategic insight that supports the thesis.
* Peer validation:

  * Other endowments/foundations independently echo concerns or enthusiasm he surfaced.

**Negative Moments**

* Surprise:

  * A GP’s risk or governance issue comes out through someone else’s comment or media, and he hadn’t seen it.
* “All marketing, no substance” weeks:

  * Back-to-back GP meetings where everyone sounds similar; feels like spinning wheels.
* Rework:

  * IC challenges his memo because something important wasn’t considered, forcing last-minute scrambling.

**Where Osmosis Helps Daniel**

* **Faster context gathering:**

  * Before starting a memo, he can pull what GPs, consultants, and other allocators have said on that strategy/region/approach.
* **Evidence for memos:**

  * Inline quotes from public panels and interviews to support or challenge GP claims.
* **Noise reduction:**

  * Alerts only for *relevant* topics/allocators/GPS he covers, instead of endless manual searching.

---

### Slide 19 – Inside Sarah’s Head: Mental & Emotional Rhythm

**Section pill:** Mental & Emotional
**Header:** Sarah – How She Experiences the Week

* **Monday – “Flight Check”**

  * Mental: “Are we okay? Any fires?”
  * Emotional: Calm if nothing’s broken; tense if there’s an unexpected drawdown or problem.

* **Tuesday – “Relationship and Trust”**

  * Mental: “Do I still trust these GPs? Are they being candid?”
  * Emotional: Strong preference for candid, unscripted conversations; frustration with salesy spin.

* **Wednesday – “Big Picture Day”**

  * Mental: “Where is the world going? Are we positioned for the next decade, not just the next year?”
  * Emotional: This is the intellectually satisfying part of the job.

* **Thursday – “Market Feel & Reputation”**

  * Mental: “What themes, risks, and narratives are circulating among peers and managers?”

  * Emotional: Uneasy if the pipeline feels reactive rather than intentional.

---

### Slide 20 – Sarah’s Tasks, Problems & Data Flows

**Section pill:** Jobs to Be Done
**Header:** Sarah – What She Actually Does All Week

**Core Tasks**

* Set and refine overall asset allocation and risk posture.
* Decide which strategies and GPs to back, expand, or cut.
* Lead or review major investment decisions and commitments.
* Communicate with principals:

  * Explaining performance, risks, and rationale in plain language.

* “Are we spending time on things that matter, or chasing shiny objects?”

**How Sarah Processes Information**

* Inputs:

  * Summary packs and memos from her team.
  * Direct conversations with GPs and some peers.
  * High-level conference content, CIO roundtables, interviews, podcasts.

* Processing:

  * Leverages **intuition built over many cycles**:

    * Is this manager’s story coherent across time?
    * Are they talking about risk in a way that feels real?
  * Look for patterns:

    * Are multiple managers and allocators expressing similar concerns or opportunities?

* Outputs:

  * Greenlight / redlight decisions on managers and themes.
  * Guidance to team: “We’re done with X; we want more Y; be careful with Z.”
  * Narrative to principals: “Here’s what we’re doing and why.”

**What Separates Great CIOs Like Sarah**

* Says **“no”** more often than “yes,” quickly and decisively.
* Integrates qualitative signals (tone, consistency, peer sentiment) with numbers.
* Maintains a relatively **stable core** of relationships while letting the edges evolve.

---

### Slide 21 – Sarah’s Relationships & Interactions

**Section pill:** Relationships
**Header:** Sarah – Who She’s in Conversation With

**Internal**

* Principals / Family:

  * May be sophisticated or not; either way they are ultimate stakeholders.
* Small investment team:

  * 1–3 people; heavy reliance on their prep and judgment.
* Operations / legal / tax:

  * For structuring, execution, and constraints.

**External**

* GPs:

  * Mostly those she’s already committed to or is seriously considering.
* Other CIOs:

  * Informal networks; sanity checks; sharing patterns and themes.
* Advisors (legal, tax, sometimes consultants):

  * For complex structures or new areas.

---

### Slide 22 – Sarah: Positive vs Negative Moments

**Section pill:** Moments That Matter
**Header:** Sarah – Great vs Bad Weeks

**Positive Moments**

* A GP she backed during a tough period performs well; narrative validated.
* A principal says:

  * “I finally understand why we own this.”
* She hears a theme at a roundtable and realizes:

  * “We are already positioned for this.”

**Negative Moments**

* A GP she backed is publicly questioned (governance, valuation, bad headlines) and she feels blindsided.
* A principal repeats a critical comment from a peer:

  * “Why are we in this when so-and-so is not?”
* She feels **time-starved**:

  * Too many “just okay” meetings; not enough deep thinking.

**Where Osmosis Helps Sarah**

* **Macro allocator/GP sentiment map:**

  * “What are other CIOs and big allocators saying about this theme (e.g., evergreen infra, private credit risk, AI infra)?”
* **Early detection of reputational/strategic issues:**

  * Alerts when managers or sectors she is exposed to become part of public debates, hearings, or contentious panels.
* **Prep multiplier:**

  * Before a high-stakes meeting, she can quickly see recent relevant public remarks by that manager, peers, or consultants.

## Cross-Persona & Wrap-Up

---

### Slide 23 – Comparing Their Weeks

**Section pill:** Cross-Cutting View
**Header:** How These Three Allocators Differ (and Overlap)

Comparison table:

| Dimension           | Maria (Public Plan)                       | Daniel (Endowment Associate)                 | Sarah (Family Office CIO)              |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Time Horizon        | Multi-decade, but constrained by politics | Long-term but career-level incentives matter | Multi-decade, family generational lens |
| Decision Speed      | Slow, committee-driven                    | Medium (memo + CIO)                          | Fast, concentrated                     |
| Public vs Private   | Highly public and transparent             | Mostly private, but peer-aware               | Very private                           |
| Main Pain           | Defensibility & scrutiny                  | Overload & synthesis                         | Time & judgment under uncertainty      |
| Main Emotional Risk | Public embarrassment                      | Missing a key risk                           | Permanent capital loss / misalignment  |

Key insight:

> GPs talk to all three, often with the same deck. But each persona is running a **totally different mental program** when they hear it.

---

### Slide 24 – How They Process Spoken Content Today vs With Osmosis

**Section pill:** Data & Decisions
**Header:** Spoken Content: From Noise to Signal

Two columns: **Today** vs **With Osmosis** for all three personas.

**Today**

* Panels, hearings, interviews are:

  * Half-remembered
  * Scattered across note files or internal email chains
  * Not easily searchable or reusable
* Each persona:

  * Relies on memory, scribbled notes, or what others heard.

**With Osmosis**

* Spoken content is:

  * Captured, transcribed, tagged by allocator, topic, asset class.
  * Searchable by GP/LP/consultant/themes.

Each persona benefits differently:

* **Maria:**

  * Uses peer comments & regulatory hearings to **triangulate defensibility**.
* **Daniel:**

  * Uses allocator/consultant quotes as evidence in memos.
* **Sarah:**

  * Uses aggregated allocator/GP commentary to validate or stress-test her long-term themes.

---

### Slide 25 – The Story in 30 Seconds

**Section pill:** Wrap Up
**Header:** The Allocator Week, in One Paragraph

Body:

* Maria, Daniel, and Sarah live very different lives, but they’re all trying to answer the same question:

  > “Where should we place scarce, long-term capital — and how do we justify those choices to our stakeholders?”
* Their weeks are full of:

  * Meetings, memos, board packs, political constraints, and information overload.
* Spoken content from allocators, consultants, and GPs is everywhere but **unstructured and ephemeral**.
* When Osmosis makes that content findable, synthesized, and tailored to each persona, GPs can show up **better prepared, more aligned, and more trusted**.

---

If you’d like, next step I can:

* Convert this outline into **HTML in your existing style** (full slide markup with your CSS classes), or
* Draft **speaker notes** for key slides to help your team internalize these personas even more.
