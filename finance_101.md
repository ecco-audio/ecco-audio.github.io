Here’s a draft “Finance 101” primer laid out in the same spirit as our Capital Markets 101 deck — but zoomed out to the full financial economy and explicitly showing where Osmosis sits.
---

## 1. Title & Why This Exists

**Title:** Finance 101
**Subtitle:** The Map of the Financial Economy — and Where Osmosis Fits

**Goal for the reader**

By the end, your team should:

* Know what “finance” actually *does* in the economy
* Understand the big sectors (banks, capital markets, asset managers, lenders, insurance, fintech, regulators, etc.) and how they interlock
* Decode what someone means when they say “I work in finance”
* See exactly where *capital markets* sit inside “finance” and where *Osmosis* sits inside capital markets/asset management 
* Have a crisp story in their head: how money moves, how *information* moves, and why Osmosis is valuable radar rather than just another “database”

---

## 2. Start Here — What Does “Finance” Actually Do?

**Simple definition**

Finance exists to:

1. **Move money through time**

   * Turn today’s savings into tomorrow’s spending, investing, or retirement.
2. **Move money across people and institutions**

   * From those who *have* capital (savers, investors) to those who *need* it (companies, governments, households).
3. **Price and manage risk**

   * Decide *who* bears risk (credit risk, market risk, longevity risk, etc.) and *what it costs*.

Everything else — banks, hedge funds, insurance, fintech apps — are different ways to perform those three jobs.

---

## 3. The Big Map: Money & Risk Flows

Think of the financial system as a set of pipes between four groups:

1. **Savers / Capital Providers**

   * Households (deposits, 401(k)s, brokerage accounts, life insurance policies)
   * Companies with excess cash
   * Governments with reserves
   * Institutional allocators (pensions, endowments, sovereign wealth, insurers, family offices) 

2. **Intermediaries**

   * Banks
   * Asset managers & hedge funds
   * Insurance companies
   * Specialty lenders & private credit
   * Wealth managers & RIAs
   * Payments / fintech platforms

3. **Markets & Infrastructure**

   * Stock and bond markets
   * Derivatives markets
   * Exchanges, clearinghouses, custodians, rating agencies
   * Data providers and — increasingly — intelligence tools like Osmosis

4. **Users of Capital / Risk**

   * Corporates (CapEx, M&A, working capital)
   * Governments (infrastructure, deficits)
   * Households (mortgages, student loans, credit cards)

**Core loop:**
Savers → Intermediaries → Markets → Borrowers/Real Economy → Cash flows back (interest, dividends, premiums, principal) → Savers.

Osmosis sits in the *information layer* between institutional allocators and asset managers who are raising capital from them.

---

## 4. Where Capital Markets Fit Inside “Finance”

“Finance” is the whole universe. “Capital markets” are a specific *channel* within it.

* **Capital markets** = Where long-term funding gets raised and traded via *securities*:

  * Debt (bonds, loans)
  * Equity (stocks)
  * Hybrids & structured products
* They connect **issuers** (companies, governments, securitizations) with **investors** (asset managers, insurers, pensions, etc.).
* They are heavily intertwined with:

  * **Investment banks** (underwriting, advisory, market making)
  * **Asset managers / hedge funds** (buy-side investors)
  * **Allocators** (pensions, endowments, SWFs, etc.) 

In your existing Capital Markets 101 deck, you zoomed in on just *one corridor* of this map: allocators → asset managers → investments. This Finance 101 map zooms out to show *all the corridors*, then drops Osmosis into the right spot.

## 5. The Major Sectors of Finance (Cheat Sheet Slide)

You can visualize this as a grid (one row per sector):

1. **Retail & Commercial Banking**

   * **Job:** Take deposits, make loans, provide payments and cash management.
   * **Makes money via:** Net interest margin (loan rates – deposit rates) + fees.
   * **Customers:** Households, SMEs, corporates.

2. **Investment Banking & Capital Markets**

   * **Job:** Advise on M&A, IPOs, bond deals; underwrite and distribute securities; provide trading & structuring.
   * **Makes money via:** Fees and trading revenues.
   * **Customers:** Corporates, governments, financial sponsors (PE, VC).

3. **Asset & Wealth Management**

   * **Job:** Invest money on behalf of others (mutual funds, ETFs, hedge funds, PE/VC, SMAs), manage retirement assets, advise wealthy individuals.
   * **Makes money via:** Management & performance fees on AUM. 
   * **Customers:** Retail investors, HNWIs, pensions, endowments, insurers, SWFs.

4. **Insurance & Reinsurance**

   * **Job:** Take on risk (life, health, property/casualty) in exchange for premiums; pool and diversify.
   * **Makes money via:** Underwriting profits + investment income on float.
   * **Customers:** Individuals, corporates, governments; other insurers (reinsurance).

5. **Specialty Lending / Private Credit / “Shadow Banking”**

   * **Job:** Lend outside traditional banks — direct lending, asset-backed lending, mezzanine, factoring.
   * **Makes money via:** Interest and fees; potentially some equity-like upside.
   * **Customers:** Middle-market corporates, sponsors, niche borrowers.

6. **Payments, Cards & Fintech**

   * **Job:** Move money (card networks, payment processors, wallets, merchant acquiring, BNPL, neo-banks).
   * **Makes money via:** Interchange, processing fees, spreads, SaaS fees.

7. **Market Infrastructure & Data**

   * **Job:** Run exchanges, clearing, custody, market data, and intelligence platforms.
   * **Makes money via:** Transaction fees, data subscriptions, software licenses.
   * **Customers:** All other financial institutions and corporates.

8. **Public Sector & Regulation**

   * **Job:** Central banks, regulators, finance ministries. Set rules, backstop crises, manage currencies and macro-financial stability.

9. **Corporate Finance Inside Non-Financials**

   * **Job:** Treasury, FP&A, corporate development teams at “real economy” companies.
   * **Makes money via:** Not a P&L line item; they optimize capital structure and liquidity for the business.

Osmosis primarily sells into **asset & wealth management**, especially capital-formation / IR teams at asset managers and alternative investment platforms.

---

## 6. Deep Dive — Retail & Commercial Banking

**What they do**

* Take deposits from individuals and companies.
* Extend loans (mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, small-business loans).
* Offer services: payments, FX, cash management, trade finance.

**Business model**

* Earn **net interest margin**:

  * Borrow cheaply (deposits) → lend at higher rates → keep the spread.
* Add fee income from overdrafts, card fees, account fees, and services.

**Common “I work in finance” roles here**

* Retail / SME relationship manager
* Corporate banker / coverage banker
* Credit risk / underwriting analyst
* Payments / transaction banking sales
* Product, ops, compliance, and risk roles

These roles are closer to **lending and deposits** than to capital markets. Most aren’t directly in the allocator/asset manager universe Osmosis sells into, but they’re part of how capital gets created and recycled in the system.

---

## 7. Deep Dive — Investment Banking & Capital Markets

**What they do**

* **Advisory:** M&A, restructurings, fairness opinions.
* **Underwriting:** Help clients issue stocks and bonds (IPOs, follow-ons, bond deals).
* **Markets businesses:** Sales & trading, derivatives structuring, research, prime brokerage.

**Business model**

* Transaction fees on deals (advisory + underwriting).
* Spreads and trading revenue from market making and structured products.

**Typical roles**

* Investment banking analyst/associate: build models, pitchbooks, run processes.
* Sales & trading: sell securities to investors, make markets.
* Research analyst: cover sectors, write reports.
* Capital markets / syndicate: price and distribute new issues.

Investment banks are the **bridge between issuers and investors**. On the investor side, they interface daily with **asset managers, hedge funds, and allocators** — the same ecosystem Osmosis serves, but from the *sell-side*.

---

## 8. Deep Dive — Asset & Wealth Management (Osmosis’ home turf)

This overlaps heavily with your Capital Markets 101 deck; here’s the high-level recap. 

**Core idea**

> Take capital from allocators and investors → invest it in various asset classes → charge fees for doing so.

**Key players**

* **Asset owners / allocators**: pensions, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, family offices, insurers.
* **Asset managers / GPs**: hedge funds, mutual fund complexes, PE/VC firms, private credit funds, infrastructure and real estate managers.
* **Wealth channels**: private banks, wirehouses, RIAs distributing products to HNW and mass affluent clients.

**Business model (simplified)**

* **Management fees** — a percentage of AUM, often ~2% in alternatives, lower in traditional.
* **Performance fees (“carry”)** — share of profits over a hurdle in alternatives.

This is the world where **fundraising is existential**: more AUM → more management fee revenue → more stable firm. One nine-figure mandate can be worth millions in fees over a fund’s life.

**Where Osmosis plugs in**

* Asset managers need to know **who is allocating capital, when, and to what** to win mandates before competitors.
* Traditional databases tell them “who *has* capital” and “what they did last year.” Osmosis tells them “who is *about to* allocate and what they just said in a meeting.”

---

## 9. Deep Dive — Insurance & Reinsurance

**What they do**

* Take on specific risks:

  * Life & health (will you live longer than expected?)
  * Property & casualty (will your building burn down?)
  * Specialty lines (cyber, aviation, etc.)
* Pool and price those risks, then invest the **float** — the pool of premiums collected but not yet paid out.

**Business model**

* **Underwriting margin:** premiums – expected claims and expenses.
* **Investment income:** invest float into bonds, alternatives, etc.

**Finance roles here**

* Actuaries (pricing risk), investment teams, ALM (asset-liability management), distribution, and structuring.
* From Osmosis’ perspective, large insurers are also **allocators** — they run huge investment portfolios and allocate to external managers (private credit, PE, infrastructure, etc.).

---

## 10. Deep Dive — Specialty Lending & Private Credit

**What they do**

* Provide loans outside traditional bank balance sheets:

  * Direct lending to middle-market companies
  * Mezzanine finance
  * Distressed/special situations
  * Asset-backed lending, factoring, leasing

**Why this exists**

* Banks are regulated and capital-constrained.
* Sponsors and middle-market companies still need leverage and flexible capital.
* Private credit funds step in, funded mainly by institutional allocators.

**Business model**

* Higher yields and fees than plain-vanilla bank loans, in exchange for more complexity and illiquidity.
* Very hot space: many allocators are increasing allocations to private credit specifically.

**For Osmosis**

* Private credit managers are prime customers: they’re constantly fundraising, competing for mandates, and highly sensitive to allocator pacing shifts — exactly the sort of signals Osmosis surfaces from IC meetings, consultant comments, and board books.

---

## 11. Deep Dive — Payments, Cards & Fintech

**What they do**

* Run the **plumbing of money movement**:

  * Card networks (Visa, Mastercard, AmEx)
  * Acquiring/processors (FIS, Fiserv, Adyen, Stripe)
  * Digital wallets & payment apps
  * BNPL, small-business lenders, neobanks

**Business model**

* Per-transaction fees (basis points on volume)
* Subscription/SaaS fees for software
* Interest / spreads in lending-heavy fintechs

**Relevance for Osmosis**

* Mostly outside the allocator/GP-capital formation world — but:

  * Large payments/fintech firms are **issuers** (when they tap capital markets).
  * They’re also **investment opportunities** for asset managers your customers run.

---

## 12. Deep Dive — Market Infrastructure & Data

**What they do**

* **Exchanges & venues:** run markets where securities trade.
* **Clearing & settlement:** ensure trades close, manage counterparty risk.
* **Custodians:** hold assets and manage safekeeping.
* **Data & analytics providers:** price feeds, fundamentals, performance data.

Traditional data platforms (Preqin, PitchBook, eVestment, etc.) sit here: they’re **libraries of historical commitments and fund attributes**, not real-time signal layers.

Osmosis sits closer to the **intelligence layer**:

* It doesn’t just host static data — it listens to *live conversations* (IC meetings, CIO interviews, consultant comments, board books) and turns them into **real-time, allocator-specific signals and alerts**.

---

## 13. Deep Dive — Public Sector & Regulators

**Key players**

* **Central banks** (Fed, ECB, BOE, etc.): monetary policy, lender of last resort.
* **Regulators** (SEC, CFTC, national regulators): conduct, disclosure, prudential oversight.
* **Finance ministries**: fiscal policy, sovereign debt issuance.

They set the **rules of the game** and strongly influence:

* Bank lending and capital
* What asset managers can offer to whom
* How much leverage insurers, pensions, and others can take
* Disclosure and public meeting requirements — which is part of why many allocator decisions are made in forums whose recordings/minutes Osmosis can monitor. 

---

## 14. Deep Dive — Corporate Finance inside “Real Economy” Firms

In non-financial companies (manufacturing, tech, retail, etc.), “finance” typically means:

* **Treasury:** cash, liquidity, FX, funding, bank relationships.
* **FP&A:** budgeting, forecasting, analysis.
* **Corporate development:** M&A, strategic investments.
* **Investor relations (IR):** talking to public shareholders and analysts.

These teams are **clients** of the broader financial system (banks, markets, asset managers). They’re not Osmosis’ target buyer, but they’re the ones whose capital-raising or M&A decisions generate the *underlying transactions* that asset managers invest in.

---

## 15. “I Work in Finance” — What That Usually Means

When someone says “I work in finance,” they usually fall into one of a few buckets:

1. **Sell-side**

   * Investment banking, sales & trading, equity research, prime brokerage.
   * Paid by **issuers and investors** to provide advice, execution, and liquidity.
   * Metrics: deal volume, trading volume, client wallet share.

2. **Buy-side**

   * Asset managers, hedge funds, PE/VC, private credit, real-money institutions.
   * Paid by **investors/allocators** via management & performance fees.
   * Metrics: AUM, performance, capital raised, mandates won.

3. **Banking / Lending**

   * Retail & commercial banking, corporate lending, specialty finance.
   * Metrics: loan growth, net interest margin, credit losses.

4. **Insurance / Risk**

   * Underwriters, actuaries, investment teams at insurers.
   * Metrics: combined ratio, ROE, investment returns.

5. **Infrastructure & Data**

   * Exchanges, data providers, fintech infra, regtech.
   * Metrics: volume, subscriptions, retention, platform usage.

6. **Support & Control Functions**

   * Risk, compliance, ops, finance, product control, technology.

Osmosis sells into the **buy-side**, specifically the people whose job is to **raise and deploy capital**: Heads of IR/Distribution, relationship managers, and PMs at asset managers.

---

## 16. How Information Flows (Not Just Money)

There are really *two* sets of pipes in finance: **money pipes** and **information pipes**.

**Formal information channels**

* Regulatory filings (10-Ks, annual reports, official minutes)
* Databases (Preqin, PitchBook, consultant reports)
* Ratings, research, published thought pieces

These are **slow, structured, and backward-looking**. Great for “what happened last year.”

**Informal / spoken channels**

* Investment committee (IC) and board meetings
* CIO interviews and conferences
* Consultant recommendations and manager reviews
* Side comments from staff PMs, board members, advisors

This is where allocators actually **decide**: pacing changes, searches, manager preferences, themes they want exposure to. Those decisions are almost always *spoken first* and only show up in databases or official minutes weeks/months later. 

**Where Osmosis fits**

* Osmosis listens to these public spoken conversations in real time, extracts:

  * *Who* is allocating
  * *What* they said
  * *Which* strategies/check sizes and time frames they’re talking about
* Then pushes **personalized alerts and watchlists** to capital-formation teams, so they know who to call *this week*, not next quarter.

Think: databases = library, Osmosis = radar.

---

## 17. Example Flow — From Worker Paycheck to PE Fund to Company

This is a good narrative slide to tie the whole system together.

1. **Worker gets paid**

   * Contributes a portion of salary into a public pension or 401(k).

2. **Pension / allocator**

   * Aggregates contributions into a huge pool of capital.
   * Decides, in an IC meeting, to increase allocation to private equity from, say, 8% → 10% over the next 3 years.
   * Discusses pacing, check sizes, and what strategies they like (e.g., mid-market buyout, sector specialists).

3. **Osmosis moment**

   * That discussion happens in a public meeting or recorded session.
   * Osmosis monitors it, extracts: “Allocator X wants to increase PE, targeting $Y over next Z quarters.”
   * Within hours, an Osmosis customer (a PE platform) gets an alert: “This pension is ramping PE pacing; here’s the exact quote; here’s who said it; here’s their consultant; here’s the context.”

4. **Asset manager / GP**

   * Capital formation team calls/visits the pension early with a tailored pitch.
   * If they win a commitment, that money is drawn down and invested into target companies.

5. **Company**

   * Gets capital from the PE fund (equity or debt).
   * Uses it to build factories, hire, launch new products.

6. **Back to worker**

   * Over time, exits generate returns for the pension.
   * Pension pays out retirement benefits.

Without Osmosis, the asset manager often hears about the allocator’s shift only when the formal RFP goes out — by then, the field is crowded and hit rates are low. With Osmosis, they get into the dialogue earlier and see ~3–4x better “presentation hit rates” vs industry norms.

---

## 18. Where Osmosis Sits on the Finance Map

You can re-use the allocator–asset manager–investments diagram from Capital Markets 101 and overlay Osmosis. 

**Layers**

* **Capital providers (allocators)** — pensions, endowments, SWFs, insurers, family offices.
* **Gatekeepers & intermediaries** — consultants, OCIOs, placement agents.
* **Asset managers (GPs)** — PE, VC, private credit, hedge funds, real estate, infrastructure.
* **Real economy investments** — companies, projects, assets.

**Osmosis’ exact niche**

* Monitors **public allocator meetings and related content** in real time.
* Uses AI to extract:

  * Who is allocating
  * Strategy, size, timing
  * Influencers and relationships
* Delivers **personalized, speaker-attributed alerts** and **watchlists** to:

  * Heads of IR / Distribution
  * Capital formation and relationship managers
  * PMs who care about who’s deploying capital into their strategy

**One-sentence value prop (for this broader map)**

> Osmosis is the real-time allocator intelligence layer for the buy-side — telling asset managers who is buying, what they said, and how to reach them before anyone else.

---

## 19. ROI & “Why This Matters” in Finance Terms

For a team that now understands the whole map, you can anchor ROI in simple finance math:

* One $100M mandate at ~1% average fee over 5 years ≈ **$5M in revenue**.
* Osmosis costs a tiny fraction of that; one incremental win is 100×+ ROI, multiple wins can hit 1,000×.
* Customers regularly attribute specific nine-figure mandates to signals surfaced by Osmosis, and see 3–4x higher “presentation hit rates” vs the ~5% industry norm.

In the context of the *entire* financial system, Osmosis is tiny in dollar terms — but hyper-leveraged: changing *who gets into which rooms first* at the allocator level has outsized impact on who wins the mandates that drive billions of AUM.

---

## 20. Glossary — Big-Finance Terms Your Team Will Hear

You already have a GP/LP/AUM glossary in the Capital Markets 101 deck; this one adds whole-system vocabulary. 

You can table this, but here are key entries:

* **Sell-side** — Firms that sell securities / services: banks, brokers, dealers, research shops.
* **Buy-side** — Firms that buy securities on behalf of clients: asset managers, hedge funds, PE/VC, insurance investment arms.
* **Capital markets** — Markets where long-term funding is raised via securities.
* **Primary vs secondary markets** — New issuance vs trading of existing securities.
* **Net interest margin (NIM)** — Lenders’ core spread: loan yields minus funding costs.
* **Float** — Insurance premiums or other funds held before payout; invested in markets.
* **Shadow banking** — Credit intermediation outside regulated banks (funds, securitizations, etc.).
* **Allocator** — Institution that decides where to place large pools of capital (pensions, endowments, SWFs, family offices, insurers).
* **Mandate** — An allocator’s commitment to a manager or product (e.g., $150M into a PE fund).
* **Pacing** — The speed and size at which allocators commit to strategies over time.
* **OCIO** — Outsourced CIO: external firm that manages an allocator’s portfolio with discretion.
* **IR / Capital formation** — Teams at asset managers responsible for raising and retaining capital from allocators.
