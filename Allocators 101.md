Allocators 101
**Who holds the money, what they’re solving for, and how they actually decide**

---

### 0. Why this exists

In the capital markets primer, we zoomed out: allocators → asset managers → real‑world investments, and Osmosis lives on that first arrow.

This primer zooms all the way in on the **allocator side of the table** so our teams can look at any LP in the wild and immediately “get”:

* Who are they actually serving?
* What problem are they solving for?
* How do they set goals?
* What do they have to report and to whom?
* How much risk can they really take, and why?

If you understand those five things, your conversations with capital formation teams get a lot sharper, fast.

---

## 1. What is an allocator, really?

A simple working definition:

> **An allocator is an institution (or family) that stewards a pool of capital on behalf of someone else and decides which asset managers get to run slices of that capital.**

Key characteristics:

* **They are fiduciaries.** Their first obligation is to the beneficiaries or stakeholders they serve (retirees, students, policyholders, citizens, families).
* **They usually don’t pick individual stocks or deals.** Instead they pick **managers** and **strategies**.
* **They think in decades, not quarters.** Even when the politics around them are very short‑term.
* **They live in a governance machine.** Boards, ICs, consultants, regulators, auditors—lots of people looking over their shoulder.

In the GP/LP language from the primer, allocators are the **LPs**: they provide capital and hire GPs (asset managers) to put it to work.

---

## 2. The allocator’s job in one sentence

For almost every allocator on your list, their job can be boiled down to:

> **Turn a pool of promises into a portfolio that can keep those promises—with acceptable risk and defensible process.**

* **Public pensions**: “We promised a teacher a check every month for life. Can we pay it?”
* **Endowments & foundations**: “We promised to fund a university or mission forever. Can we hit our spending rule without blowing up the corpus?”
* **Insurance general accounts**: “We promised policyholders we’d be there when bad things happen. Can we meet claims and satisfy regulators?”
* **Sovereign funds & foreign pensions**: “We promised citizens long‑term prosperity or retirement security.”
* **Family & multi‑family offices**: “We promised the family (explicitly or implicitly) to grow and protect their wealth across generations.”

Two parts of that mandate matter for us:

1. **Keep the promises** (liability‑aware, risk‑constrained).
2. **Defensible process** (if challenged—by a board, regulator, rating agency, journalist—they can show a sane path from information → decision).

Osmosis plugs into the second part: we surface the **spoken inputs** that shape their process (IC meetings, consultant remarks, CIO interviews) *before* they show up in static databases.

## 3. Stakeholders & obligations (by allocator family)

Let’s walk the major allocator “families” in intuitive terms, focusing on **who they serve** and **what keeps them up at night**.

### 3.1 US public plans (state & local pensions, public university systems)

**Who they are:**
State & local retirement systems, teachers’ plans, public university regents (UTIMCO, CalPERS, CalSTRS, TRS Texas, UC Regents, etc.).

**Stakeholders:**

* Primary: teachers, firefighters, state/city workers, public university systems.
* Secondary: taxpayers, legislators, unions, rating agencies, media.

**Obligations:**

* Pay **lifetime, inflation‑linked benefits** on time.
* Maintain an acceptable **funded status** (assets vs liabilities).
* Follow open‑meeting and public records laws.
* Demonstrate “prudent person” behavior under intense public scrutiny.

**How they think about goals:**

* Return target often framed as a **discount rate** (e.g., 6.5–7.0%).
* “Can we earn our assumed rate without taking unacceptable blow‑up risk?”
* Very explicit **policy portfolio** (e.g., 35% public equity, 20% PE, 15% credit, etc.).
* Heavy focus on **pacing** (“how many commitments per year in PE/credit/infra to reach target allocation”).

**Reporting & transparency:**

* Among the **most transparent allocators in the world.**
* Publish board agendas, IC books, staff memos, sometimes full video/audio.
* Minutes often detail: manager line‑ups, consultant recommendations, pacing plans, risk discussions.

This is *prime Osmosis territory*: we can see **exactly** who they’re considering, what the consultant said, and what concerns the CIO raised—usually within hours.

**Risk & investing posture:**

* Long‑term horizon, but **political and career risk are real.**
* Tend to like **scaled, established managers**, with defined **emerging manager buckets** for smaller GPs.
* Need portfolios that can survive multiple recessions and headlines like “State Pension Loses Billions in Risky Bets.”

---

### 3.2 Taft‑Hartley / multi‑employer plans

**Who they are:**
Union and industry pension plans (construction trades, teamsters, electrical workers, etc.).

**Stakeholders:**

* Union members and beneficiaries.
* Union leadership and employer sponsors.

**Obligations:**

* Keep the fund solvent and avoid “critical and declining” status.
* Balance union politics (“support labor‑friendly strategies”) with fiduciary duty.

**Reporting & transparency:**

* Varies. Many publish minutes and some meeting materials, but not at the same depth/standardization as big state plans.
* Still enough transparency to see **manager searches and pacing themes** for top plans.

**Risk posture:**

* Similar liability profile to public pensions but typically smaller, more concentrated.
* Often rely heavily on **consultants** and **fund‑of‑funds / manager‑of‑managers** because they lack large internal staff.

---

### 3.3 Private & public university endowments; foundations; mission investors

This grouping covers:

* **Private university endowments** (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, etc.).
* **Public university systems** (UTIMCO, UC, large publics).
* **Private foundations** (Gates, Ford, Rockefeller, Packard).
* **Operating foundations / NGOs / faith‑based investors / hospital systems** (Mayo, Wellcome Trust, church pensions).

**Stakeholders:**

* Universities: students, faculty, future generations, donors.
* Foundations: grantees, communities, donors, boards.
* Faith‑based / NGOs: mission and congregations/communities served.
* Hospitals: patients and health‑system operations.

**Obligations:**

* Maintain **perpetual or very long‑term capital** while supporting annual **spending rules** (often ~4–5% of AUM).
* Align investments with **mission & values** (ESG, exclusions, impact).

**How they think about goals:**

* “Real return” lens: **CPI + 4–5%** after fees (to fund spending).
* More comfortable with **higher alternatives allocations** (40–60%+ in PE/VC/real assets for top endowments).
* Sophisticated discussion around **manager selection alpha vs beta**, and **illiquidity premia**.

**Reporting & transparency:**

* Public university systems: often quite transparent—board books and sometimes meeting recordings.
* Private universities & private foundations: selective. Annual reports and 990 filings give some data, but not the same richness of meeting transcripts.
* NGOs/faith‑based/hospitals: very mixed; some are as open as public pensions, others are opaque.

**Risk posture:**

* Generally **higher tolerance for illiquidity and volatility** than pensions, especially in elite endowments.
* Will take more **concentrated, idiosyncratic manager risk** if they believe in a team.
* Very focused on **manager quality, alignment, and edge**—this is where nuanced spoken content (“what did the CIO really say about xyz strategy?”) matters a lot.

---

### 3.4 Insurance general accounts & corporate pensions

**Insurance general accounts**

* Stakeholders: policyholders, regulators (NAIC), rating agencies, shareholders (for public insurers).
* Obligations: match long‑dated liabilities; maintain capital ratios and ratings.
* Goals: maximize **spread** between investment yield and promised policy crediting rates; tightly constrained by capital rules.
* Transparency: statutory filings, earnings calls, NAIC schedules; some CIO commentary but fewer deep public IC discussions.
* Risk posture: **return‑per‑unit‑capital** is king; heavy in fixed income and structured products; alternatives are often **capital‑efficient yield (private credit, real estate, infra)** rather than high‑volatility equity.

**Corporate DB pensions (GM, AT&T, IBM, etc.)**

* Stakeholders: corporate CFO/board, employees/retirees, shareholders.
* Obligations: close funding gap without blowing up earnings volatility.
* Goals: often in **“de‑risking” mode**—hedge liabilities (LDI), reduce equity risk, annuitize or offload to insurers over time.
* Transparency: 10‑Ks, 5500 filings, some public commentary, but rarely detailed IC minutes.
* Risk posture: more conservative and increasingly liability‑hedged; more tactical in alternatives; more CFO‑driven than CIO‑driven.

---

### 3.5 Foreign pensions and sovereign wealth funds

**Who they are:**
Canadian plans (CPP Investments, Ontario Teachers’), Dutch/APG, UK USS, AustralianSuper, plus sovereign funds like NBIM (Norway), GIC, Temasek, ADIA, PIF.

**Stakeholders:**

* Citizens and retirees of their countries.
* Governments, finance ministries, and, for SWFs, often a head of state.

**Obligations:**

* Preserve and grow national wealth or retirement capital across **multi‑generational horizons**.
* For some SWFs: diversify away from commodity dependence (oil wealth → financial wealth).

**Goals & risk:**

* Many run **sophisticated, internally managed portfolios** and also allocate to external GPs.
* Risk tolerance varies hugely:

  * NBIM: broad, relatively low‑cost global beta with ESG overlays.
  * GIC/Temasek/CAD plans: heavy in private markets and direct deals.
* Often **very large check writers** for flagship funds.

**Transparency:**

* Big range. NBIM and some Canadian/European plans are highly transparent (public reports, hearings, CIO interviews).
* Gulf and Asian SWFs can be quite opaque, with occasional high‑level commentary.

---

### 3.6 Family offices & multi‑family offices

**Who they are:**
Single‑family offices (Cascade, MSD, Soros) and multi‑family offices (Bessemer Trust, Pitcairn, etc.).

**Stakeholders:**

* A family (or set of families), usually ultra‑high‑net‑worth.
* Often a patriarch/matriarch, next‑gen leadership, and sometimes an investment committee.

**Obligations:**

* Preserve and grow wealth across generations.
* Manage **tax**, **concentration** (e.g., a core operating company or big public stake), and **family politics**.
* Support philanthropy, lifestyle spending, and sometimes operating businesses.

**Goals & risk:**

* Extremely **idiosyncratic.**

  * Some are ultra‑conservative, wealth‑preservation only.
  * Others are effectively mini endowments with heavy PE/VC allocations.
* Often prefer **co‑invests and direct deals** where they can lean on their own network.

**Transparency:**

* Among the **least transparent** allocators.
* Very limited public meetings; sometimes show up through conference remarks or occasional press.

For Osmosis, they are **important but low‑signal** from public content; we usually infer their behavior via **advisors, MFOs, and their GP relationships.**

---

## 4. How allocators define goals & “success”

Regardless of type, allocators usually answer four core questions when setting goals:

1. **What are our liabilities or spending needs?**

   * Pensions: benefit payments over 40–70 years.
   * Endowments/foundations: X% spending rule + inflation.
   * Insurers: expected claims + capital buffers.
   * SWFs: broad fiscal stability or future generations.
   * Families: multi‑generation wealth, philanthropy, sometimes operating business.

2. **What is the required return?**

   * Expressed as a **discount rate** (pensions) or **real return target** (CPI + spread).
   * Drives how much risk they *have* to take.

3. **What is our risk budget?**

   * Volatility: how much mark‑to‑market pain can they stomach?
   * Drawdown: how big a loss would trigger political/regulatory panic?
   * Illiquidity: what percentage can be in 10‑year locked funds?

4. **What constraints do we have?**

   * Regulatory (NAIC, ERISA).
   * Board policies (e.g., max % per manager, ESG exclusions).
   * Reputation (certain sectors off‑limits).
   * Capacity (team bandwidth to underwrite complex strategies).

Those answers roll up into a **policy portfolio** (strategic asset allocation), which is then expressed as:

* **Target allocations** to each asset class (public equity, PE, credit, real assets, etc.).
* **Pacing plans** for private markets commitments.
* **Risk limits** (tracking error, leverage, concentration).

The interesting part for Osmosis is that **changes** to these answers are almost always **spoken before they’re written.**

* “We’re thinking about increasing private credit from 5% to 8%.”
* “We want to add more emerging managers in infrastructure.”
* “We’re pausing new VC commitments for 12–18 months.”

Our product is literally designed to catch those spoken changes first and turn them into alerts and watchlist updates.

## 5. Governance, decision‑making, and gatekeepers

Allocators don’t just wake up and wire $200M to a GP. There’s a governance stack.

### 5.1 Common governance structure

Most large allocators have some version of:

* **Board / Regents / Trustees**
  Set high‑level policy (discount rate, policy portfolio, risk appetite). Approve big manager commitments. Often meet quarterly.

* **Investment committee (IC)**
  A subset of the board plus senior staff. This is where **manager line‑ups are debated**, pacing is set, and approvals happen.

* **Staff investment team**
  CIO, deputy CIOs, PMs, analysts. They do the legwork: underwriting managers, building recommendations, managing relationships.

* **Consultants & OCIOs**
  External advisors who either:

  * Provide **non‑discretionary advice** (traditional consultants like Meketa, Callan, NEPC, Cambridge, Wilshire).
  * Or **take discretion** and act as an OCIO (Mercer, Aon, Hirtle Callaghan, etc.).

* **Product allocators (MoM, fund‑of‑funds, MFOs)**
  Build multi‑manager products on behalf of smaller institutions or families.

Consultants and OCIOs are especially important for Osmosis: they’re **multipliers**—one recommendation can translate into commitments from a dozen clients. We position this explicitly in the capital markets primer as part of the intermediary ecosystem.

### 5.2 The decision journey (simplified)

For a new manager or strategy:

1. **Signal appears**

   * Staff hears about a manager or strategy (peers, conferences, consultants, Osmosis‑type intel).
2. **Initial screen**

   * Does this fit policy, pacing, and risk? Do we have capacity?
3. **Diligence**

   * Meetings, data requests, on‑sites, reference calls.
4. **Staff & consultant memo**

   * Written recommendation, pros/cons, sizing, fees.
5. **IC discussion**

   * The “meeting that matters” for us—this is where support, concerns, and positioning are spoken out loud.
6. **Vote / approval**

   * Manager is approved, sized, and slotted into the pipeline.
7. **Documentation & reporting**

   * Flows back to board materials, public minutes, databases.

We deliberately focus on the **IC and consultant stages**, because that’s where our customers either win or lose the mandate. Our alerts often come off the back of these meetings: “Texas Teachers IC just discussed increasing private credit pacing to 8%; CIO wants options by next meeting.”

---

## 6. Transparency & reporting: where the signals live

Using your table’s transparency column, you can think of allocators on a spectrum:

**High transparency (signal‑rich):**

* **US public plans** (state/local pensions, some Taft‑Hartley, public university regents).

  * Publish board books, IC books, agendas, often video/audio.
  * You can see: manager line‑ups, consultant recommendations, pacing, risk debates.
* **Some foreign pensions** and **Canadian/European funds**.
* Some **foundations/endowments** that share detailed reports and conference remarks.

**Medium transparency (signal, but more indirect):**

* **Consultants & OCIOs**

  * Their views appear in board books and public presentations.
* **Large private university endowments & foundations**

  * Speeches, conference panels, investor letters.
* **Insurance general accounts & corporate pensions**

  * Earnings calls, regulatory filings, CIO interviews.
* **Manager‑of‑managers, multi‑family offices**

  * Whitepapers, events, speaking at allocator conferences.

**Low transparency (signal is sparse):**

* **Family offices**

  * Mostly private; you see them indirectly (through deals, press, GP anecdotes).
* Some **SWFs** and **faith‑based investors/NGOs** that rarely publish detailed meetings.

For Osmosis, this spectrum matters because it tells us **where we can build a true radar**, not just a library:

* For high‑transparency allocators, we can ingest IC meetings, hearings, and board books in near‑real‑time, attribute quotes to speakers, and trigger alerts within hours.
* For medium transparency, we lean on **events, interviews, and consultant content**.
* For low transparency, we focus on **their advisors, counterparties, and the platforms they appear on.**

---

## 7. Risk posture & investing objectives (by allocator type)

A helpful mental shortcut is to plot allocators on two axes:

* **Risk tolerance** (low → high)
* **Illiquidity tolerance** (low → high)

Very roughly:

* **High risk / high illiquidity tolerance:**

  * Elite university endowments, some foundations, some SWFs, some family offices.
  * Higher PE/VC/real assets allocations, more concentrated bets, more appetite for emerging managers.

* **Moderate risk / high illiquidity tolerance:**

  * Large public pensions, foreign pensions, church/healthcare systems.
  * Big private markets programs but with heavier governance and consultant involvement.

* **Low–moderate risk / low–moderate illiquidity:**

  * Insurance general accounts, corporate DBs in de‑risking mode.
  * Focus on yield, capital efficiency, and risk‑based capital constraints.

* **Idiosyncratic / context‑dependent:**

  * Family offices & MFOs, faith‑based, some NGOs.
  * Their posture is as much about **people** (CIO, patriarch, board chair) as about institutional type.

When you talk to capital formation teams, they’re constantly mapping this risk picture:

* “This public pension can’t be my first close; board won’t go first on a new strategy.”
* “This endowment will take more risk if we can show edge and alignment.”
* “This insurer cares less about 25% IRR and more about stable, capital‑efficient yield.”

We want our teams to be able to intuit the same mapping when they see an allocator name in an alert.

## 8. The allocator universe: quick sketches by rank

Using your table, here’s a **one‑line mental model** for each category, plus why it matters for us:

1. **US Public Plans (state & local pensions; state investment boards)**

   * **What they do:** Run retirement assets for public employees; very public process.
   * **Obligations:** Pay pensions, manage funded status, satisfy boards/legislators.
   * **Transparency:** Very high; these are **signal engines** for Osmosis.
   * **Osmosis note:** Top priority. Many of our best alerts and customer “wins” start here.

2. **Consultants (Meketa, Callan, RVK, NEPC, Cambridge, Wilshire)**

   * **What they do:** Advise allocators on asset mix & manager selection; write the memos.
   * **Allocator?:** No, but **gatekeepers**.
   * **Transparency:** Appear in board books & public presentations.
   * **Osmosis note:** One consultant view can make or break a fundraise; we surface when they recommend or sour on a strategy.

3. **OCIOs (Mercer, Aon, BlackRock OCIO, Russell, SEI, Hirtle Callaghan)**

   * **What they do:** Act as outsourced CIO with discretion to allocate.
   * **Allocator?:** They wield allocator **power** across multiple underlying clients.
   * **Osmosis note:** High‑leverage targets; one OCIO relationship can open a portfolio of small and mid‑sized LPs.

4. **Public University Regents / Endowments (UTIMCO, UC Regents, UVA BOV)**

   * **What they do:** Invest public university assets; often publish books/audio like public pensions.
   * **Obligations:** Support operations and long‑term growth of the system.
   * **Osmosis note:** Similar to public pensions in transparency, with more endowment‑style risk appetite.

5. **Taft‑Hartley / Multi‑Employer Plans**

   * **What they do:** Union/industry pension plans.
   * **Obligations:** Keep negotiated pension promises; respond to union politics.
   * **Osmosis note:** Medium transparency but often **consultant‑heavy**, making consultant intel critical.

6. **Asset Managers (GPs)**

   * **What they do:** Compete for mandates; present to allocators.
   * **Allocator?:** No—they are our customers.
   * **Osmosis note:** We help them see **who is buying what, when**, and what consultants/allocators are saying about their strategy and competitors.

7. **Manager of Managers (MoM) / fund‑of‑funds**

   * **What they do:** Package multi‑manager products; act as product allocators.
   * **Obligations:** Provide diversification and manager access to smaller LPs.
   * **Osmosis note:** Act as a “distribution layer” into many smaller, opaque LPs.

8. **Private University Endowments (HMC, Yale, Princeton, MITIMCo)**

   * **What they do:** Run large, sophisticated portfolios with heavy alternatives.
   * **Obligations:** Perpetual capital; support annual spending.
   * **Transparency:** Medium‑low (selective, but CIOs speak at conferences).
   * **Osmosis note:** High‑signal when they do speak; they are **taste‑makers** other allocators watch.

9. **Foundations (private)**

   * **What they do:** Invest philanthropic endowments.
   * **Transparency:** Low–medium; 990‑PF data, occasional reports and talks.
   * **Osmosis note:** Less volume of public meetings, but when they speak, it’s often thematic and influential.

10. **Insurance General Accounts**

* **What they do:** Invest insurer balance sheets; heavy ALM constraints.
* **Obligations:** Meet claims, satisfy regulators, protect ratings.
* **Osmosis note:** Growing importance in private credit and structured products; more signals via earnings calls and industry events.

11. **Corporate Pensions (DB)**

* **What they do:** Sponsor defined‑benefit pensions; de‑risking over time.
* **Transparency:** Low public meetings; clues in filings and earnings.
* **Osmosis note:** Smaller volume of spoken content; more interesting via consultants, OCIOs, and big co‑sponsored events.

12. **Foreign Pensions (ex‑US)**

* **What they do:** Retirement assets abroad; often large and sophisticated.
* **Transparency:** Medium; varies by country.
* **Osmosis note:** Important check writers; signals show up in global conferences and some parliamentary hearings.

13. **Sovereign Wealth Funds**

* **What they do:** State‑owned investment funds (oil wealth, FX reserves, etc.).
* **Transparency:** Generally low; selective disclosures.
* **Osmosis note:** When they speak, it’s big, directional signals (“we are increasing infra/credit/tech by $Xbn”).

14. **Family Offices**

* **What they do:** Invest a single family’s wealth; highly bespoke.
* **Transparency:** Very low; relationship and network‑driven.
* **Osmosis note:** We triangulate via GPs who talk about them and via multi‑family offices.

15. **Multi‑Family Offices (MFOs)**

* **What they do:** Manage pooled wealth for multiple families; behave like boutique allocators.
* **Osmosis note:** Important nodes that aggregate decisions for otherwise invisible families.

16. **Foundations/NGOs (operating)**

* **What they do:** Run mission‑driven portfolios (operating NGOs, charities).
* **Transparency:** Low; occasional mission‑investing conferences.
* **Osmosis note:** Smaller in check size; more ESG/impact‑focused signals.

17. **Faith‑Based Investors / Church Pension Funds**

* **What they do:** Invest on behalf of religious organizations; often with values screens.
* **Osmosis note:** Thematic value—strong barometer for ESG/values‑driven investing trends.

18. **Healthcare Systems / Hospital Endowments**

* **What they do:** Manage investment pools for hospitals and health systems.
* **Osmosis note:** Medium check sizes; mission‑sensitive; increasingly active in alternatives.

19. **Municipal Treasuries & Cash Pools**

* **What they do:** Invest short‑duration operating cash.
* **Allocator?:** Yes, but typically not mandate‑scale for private funds.
* **Osmosis note:** Lower priority for mandate hunting; more relevant for short‑term/cash products.

## 9. What this means for Osmosis & our sales motion

### 9.1 Mental model for our team

When you see an allocator name in an alert, you want to automatically answer:

1. **What kind of promises are they trying to keep?**
2. **Who do they have to justify themselves to (board, regulator, taxpayers, family)?**
3. **How transparent are they—do we have a live radar or just occasional pings?**
4. **What is their likely risk & illiquidity posture?**
5. **Who are their gatekeepers (consultants, OCIOs, MFOs)?**

Our product exists to turn those answers into **actionable intelligence**:

* Real‑time alerts when **ICs and CIOs** talk about pacing, strategy shifts, and manager preferences.
* Speaker‑attributed quotes that become **openers** (“Here’s what your CIO said on Tuesday…”).
* Watchlists and routes that automatically surface **the right allocators, by plan type, strategy, and check size** for each capital formation rep.

### 9.2 How capital formation teams actually use this

From the sequencing and outreach playbooks:

* Senior IR / Heads of Capital Formation use allocator intel to:

  * Prioritize which funds and strategies to push *now* based on **who is in market**.
  * Tailor narratives to **specific allocator constraints** (public pension vs endowment vs insurer).
* Associates and RMs use it to:

  * Build **lead lists** of allocators actively discussing their strategy this week.
  * Prep for meetings with **exact quotes** and recent IC context.
  * Map influence networks: which consultant is driving which allocator.

Our edge is speed: **we turn spoken allocator decisions into alerts within hours**, not quarters. That’s what lets our customers “be first in the room with the right angle” and consistently find nine‑figure mandates before they hit legacy databases.

---

## 10. The allocator story in 3 lines

* **Allocators are fiduciaries turning promises into portfolios.** Their constraints—liabilities, politics, regulation, mission—explain almost everything about how they invest.
* **Different allocator families see the world differently.** Public pensions, endowments, insurers, SWFs, and family offices all have distinct goals, risk appetites, and transparency levels.
* **Their most important decisions are spoken before they’re written.** Osmosis captures those allocator conversations in real‑time and turns them into the signals our customers use to win mandates faster.
