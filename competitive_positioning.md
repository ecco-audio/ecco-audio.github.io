Here’s a working deep‑dive you can hand to the team as a primer on the market and where Osmosis sits in it as of **December 2, 2025**.

---

## 0. Executive Snapshot

**Category story**

* Private markets are huge and still growing fast. Preqin projected alternatives AUM to reach **$16.3T by end‑2023** and industry TAM estimates for private‑markets data alone sit around **$8B today, growing to ~$18B by 2030**. ([Preqin][1])
* The biggest asset managers and data giants are in an arms race to own the **“private markets data stack”**:

  * **BlackRock acquired Preqin for ~$3.2B** (closed March 2025). ([Wikipedia][2])
  * **S&P Global agreed to acquire With Intelligence for $1.8B** (announced Oct 2025). ([S&P Global Investor Relations][3])
  * **Nasdaq bought eVestment for $705M** back in 2017. ([Nasdaq Investor Relations][4])

**The gap**

* These platforms are **libraries**: they excel at historical fund data, benchmarking, and contacts—but they **do not capture what allocators actually say in meetings in real time**.
* That’s the “disappearing data” Osmosis is built around: allocator voice in boardrooms, ICs, hearings, and CIO/consultant remarks that shape mandates before they ever show up in a database. 

**Osmosis in one line**

> **Osmosis is a real‑time allocator intelligence platform that listens to public meetings and documents as they happen, then turns what was said into personalized alerts, relationship maps, and automated workflows—so your team is first in the room with the right angle.**

**Why we exist**

* Your buyers win by **spending more time selling and less time doing admin**:

  * Research: “Who should we be selling to?”
  * Meeting prep: “What should we say and how?”
  * Internal defense: “Why aren’t we selling more?”
  * Competitive intel: “Who else is in the room?”
* Legacy tools don’t solve this because:

  * Data is **old and shallow**.
  * Tech is **2000s‑era databases** at the core.
  * They lack **workflow‑level outputs** (who to call, what to say this week).

**Osmosis’ position**

* We’re **not a database replacement**. We sit **above** Preqin / PitchBook / Dakota / eVestment / With Intelligence as the **real‑time radar** that tells you:

  * *Who’s allocating, what they said, who influences them, and what to do next—today.*
* We monetize the **mathematics of being first**: one $100M mandate at ~1% over 5 years = **$5M**, which is roughly **1,000× our annual cost**.

---

## 1. The Market We’re Playing In (as of late 2025)

### 1.1 Macro: Why allocator intelligence is hot

* Alternatives have gone from niche to mainstream. Preqin projects private capital AUM to keep compounding off a base of **$16T+** and to approach **$40T by 2030**. ([Preqin][1])
* As AUM and complexity grow, **allocators need more data**, and **managers need better intelligence** about:

  * Who is changing pacing, policies, and sleeves.
  * How consultants are steering line‑ups.
  * Where peers are winning (or losing) mandates.

BlackRock’s investor materials for the Preqin deal explicitly call private‑markets data an **$8B TAM growing ~12% annually to $18B by 2030**, which is why they were willing to pay **~13× 2024E revenue**. ([Q4 Capital][5])

S&P Global’s $1.8B deal for With Intelligence is framed similarly: build a **“leadership position in private markets intelligence”** by combining data, research, and analytics. ([S&P Global Investor Relations][3])

**Read: everyone is arming up around the same problem—**but almost all of that spend is still flowing into **backward‑looking databases and research products**, not real‑time allocator voice.

### 1.2 The current stack (simplified)

For our buyers (Heads of IR / Distribution, Capital Formation), the tooling world roughly falls into four buckets:

1. **Private‑markets data libraries**

   * **Preqin, PitchBook, eVestment**
   * Jobs: market sizing, fundraising benchmarking, performance data, LP profiles.

2. **Investor contact & sales intelligence**

   * **Dakota, Ipreo, institutional CRM enrichers**
   * Jobs: build call lists, route coverage, track who to call.

3. **Media + events‑driven intel**

   * **With Intelligence, PEI Group, Institutional Investor, etc.**
   * Jobs: context, networking, sponsor coverage, curated “what happened” stories.

4. **Real‑time allocator voice & signals**

   * **Osmosis (category‑defining)**
   * Jobs: “Who is talking about my strategy this week? What did they say? Who actually influences this decision? What do I do about it now?”

Osmosis is essentially a **new category** (real‑time allocator intelligence from disappearing data) that **sits across** categories 1–3, feeding them and making them more actionable.

---

## 2. Preqin: “Home of Alternatives,” now BlackRock’s data arm

### 2.1 History & evolution

* Founded in **2003** as **Private Equity Intelligence** by Mark O’Hare and Nick Arnott, initially focused on private equity performance data, often sourced via FOIA. ([Wikipedia][2])
* Rebranded as **Preqin**, expanded into a full alternatives data platform across **private equity, venture, hedge funds, private debt, real estate, infrastructure, natural resources, and secondaries**. ([Wikipedia][2])
* Acquired **Colmore** in 2021 to deepen technology and administration offerings in private markets. ([Wikipedia][2])
* In **2024**, BlackRock agreed to acquire Preqin for **£2.55B (~$3.2B)**; the deal closed in **March 2025**. Preqin is expected to add **~$240M of highly recurring revenue** in 2024 and has grown **~20% annually** over the prior three years. ([Q4 Capital][5])

Scale today:

* **1,500+ employees**, **200,000+ users** across **190,000 funds, 60,000 fund managers, and 30,000 investors**, including asset managers, insurers, pensions, wealth managers, and banks. ([Family Wealth Report][6])

### 2.2 What Preqin sells / who uses it

**Core products**

* Massive structured datasets on:

  * Funds, fund managers, LPs and commitments.
  * Performance, fundraising, deals, and benchmarks.
* Web platform + APIs + research + Preqin Pro dashboards.

**Primary users**

* GP fundraising & strategy teams (for market sizing & LP lists).
* LPs and consultants (for peer analysis & benchmarking).
* Banks and advisors (for deal comps and sponsor intel).

### 2.3 Why people love Preqin

* **Breadth and depth of data** across nearly every alternatives asset class. ([Wikipedia][2])
* **Brand trust**: widely cited in media, LP reports, and consultant decks as the default source of truth on alternatives.
* **Standardization**: a shared language for market sizing, benchmarking, and LP/GP mapping.
* The BlackRock acquisition signals to buyers that Preqin is now **“plugged into Aladdin”** and part of a much larger technology ecosystem. ([BlackRock][7])

### 2.4 Where Preqin falls short for our ICP

For Capital Formation / IR leaders trying to win **this quarter’s** mandates:

* **Update frequency**: data is **retrospective**—fund closings, commitments, and performance are updated on a lagging basis. It tells you **what happened**, not **what was said in yesterday’s IC about next quarter’s pacing**.
* **Limited voice of allocator**: no capture of live board/IC discussions, CIO remarks, or consultant commentary in context.
* **Not workflow‑native for seller use**: great for research; much less geared to “this week’s priority outreach list,” talk tracks, or alerts.

**Mental model for reps**

> *“Preqin is the library of closed‑end reality. Osmosis is the radar for what allocators are planning next.”*

We keep that distinction and often position Osmosis as the **signal layer that makes their Preqin licenses more valuable**. 

---

## 3. PitchBook: the private‑markets operating system

### 3.1 History & scale

* Founded in **2007** by **John Gabbert** in Seattle to provide granular private‑equity and VC deal intelligence. ([Wikipedia][8])
* Launched the **PitchBook Platform** (SaaS) in 2009; built out global coverage across VC, PE, and M&A. ([Wikipedia][8])
* **Morningstar** first invested in 2009, then acquired the remaining 80% in 2016, valuing PitchBook at **$225M**. ([SEC][9])
* Under Morningstar, PitchBook has become a star segment:

  * **2023 segment revenue: $551.9M**, with **>100,000 global users**. ([Morningstar Newsroom][10])
  * Q4 2023: $132M revenue; 19.1% YoY growth. ([Morningstar Newsroom][11])
  * Q4 2024 run‑rate: $162.5M in the quarter, 12.5% YoY growth; license users grew **16.4%**. ([SEC][12])
* ~3,000 employees globally as of 2024. ([Wikipedia][8])

### 3.2 What PitchBook sells / who uses it

**Core offering**

* End‑to‑end **private‑markets data platform**:

  * Companies, investors, deals, funds, LP commitments, performance, and benchmarks. ([PitchBook][13])
* Deep workflow tooling:

  * Excel / PPT plugins, CRM integrations, APIs.
  * Research reports, dashboards, indexes, LP tools, allocator content. ([PitchBook][14])

**Primary users**

* Deal teams (PE, VC, growth equity, corporate development).
* Capital formation teams (for LP lists & fundraising analytics).
* Service providers (banks, law firms, consultants).
* Increasingly, LPs and allocators using **allocator‑focused modules and research**. ([PitchBook][13])

### 3.3 Why people love PitchBook

* **UI and UX**: widely regarded as more modern and intuitive than older data platforms.
* **Breadth plus usability**: millions of companies, 1.6M+ deals, 300k+ investors, all accessible with robust filters. ([PitchBook][15])
* **Research + product velocity**: steady stream of reports, dashboards, and features (AI & ML capabilities, portfolio monitoring, etc.). ([PitchBook][14])

### 3.4 Where PitchBook falls short for our ICP

* **Not allocator‑voice native**: strong on LP commitments; weak on the **actual conversations** and governance dynamics shaping mandates and pacing.
* **Update lag and self‑report bias**: relies heavily on web‑crawled and self‑reported data; even with rigorous QA, it’s still “we capture after someone tells the world,” not “we heard it in the meeting.” ([PitchBook][15])
* **Sales workflow gap**: excellent for research and pipeline planning; less optimized around “alerts within hours telling my sales team who to call and what to reference from yesterday’s IC.”

**Mental model for reps**

> *“PitchBook tracks companies and funds. Osmosis tracks allocators and what they actually say—then turns that into this week’s outreach.”*

Again, our best play is **complement**: keep PitchBook for company/fund view; add Osmosis for allocator voice and timing.

## 4. With Intelligence: media‑led alternatives intel, now S&P’s private‑markets arm

### 4.1 History & evolution

* Origins as **Pageant Media** (founded 1997 by Charlie Kerr): a B2B magazine and events business in financial markets. Over time, it shifted towards **data subscriptions and proprietary intelligence** (brands like HFM, AltCredit, Fund Directions, Pension Bridge, Falk Marques, etc.). ([Flashes & Flames][16])
* Rebranded to **With Intelligence** and scaled rapidly:

  * Revenue grew from **£27.6M (2019)** to an estimated **£95M in FY 2024**, with EBITDA margins in the mid‑30s. ([Flashes & Flames][16])
  * Client base: **3,000+ institutional clients**, including **94 of the world’s 100 largest asset managers**. ([Flashes & Flames][16])
* Private‑equity trajectory:

  * 2020: Intermediate Capital Group (ICG) takes control at an enterprise value of ~£135M. ([Flashes & Flames][16])
  * 2023–24: Motive Partners buys a majority stake at an EV of ~£410M. ([Flashes & Flames][16])
  * **Oct 2025**: S&P Global agrees to acquire With Intelligence for **$1.8B**, positioning it as a **private‑markets data and intelligence leader** within S&P. Revenue is projected around **$130M in 2025**. ([Reuters][17])

### 4.2 What With Intelligence sells / who uses it

**Core offering**

* Hybrid **media + data + events** platform:

  * News and analysis (HFM, AltCredit, Fund Directions, etc.).
  * Databases of investors, funds, mandates, and performance (e.g., **With HFM** data service). ([Withintelligence][18])
  * Awards and networking events that concentrate allocators, managers, and service providers. ([awards.withintelligence.com][19])

**Primary users**

* Hedge fund and alternatives managers (BD, IR, product).
* Service providers to alternatives.
* Asset owners and consultants seeking curated news and peer intel.

### 4.3 Why people love With Intelligence

* **Curated, high‑signal editorial**: context, people moves, mandates, and narratives around managers and allocators.
* **Community**: events, awards, and memberships that confer status and access.
* **Growing data footprint**: investor and fund datasets integrated with content and events.

### 4.4 Where With Intelligence falls short for our ICP

* **Not systematically capturing full meeting transcripts or live audio**—it’s still largely **journalistic coverage + selective mandates data**, not full‑fidelity meeting capture.
* **Time‑to‑signal**: stories and mandate coverage land **after** key conversations, not within hours of them.
* **Limited workflow automation**: strong on insight and networking, weaker on pushing personalized call lists and talk tracks into CRM or seller inboxes.

**Mental model**

> *“With Intelligence tells you the story around alternatives. Osmosis tells you exactly what the CIO said last Tuesday—and routes that to the right seller automatically.”*

We are **complementary**: keep With for context and events; add Osmosis for **machine‑captured allocator voice and automation.**

---

## 5. Dakota: fundraiser‑built contact machine

### 5.1 History & scale

* Founded in **2006** by **Gui Costin** in Philadelphia as a firm focused on helping asset managers raise capital. ([Dakota][20])
* Built **Dakota Marketplace**, a database of LPs, GPs, and companies, described as “**the only investment database built by fundraisers for fundraisers**.” ([Dakota][21])
* Their team claims to have raised **$40B+** since inception and to serve **6,000+ fundraisers**. ([Dakota][22])
* Revenue (3rd‑party estimates): around **$9.5M in 2024**, up from $6.5M in 2023, with growth after a dip in 2022. ([Latka][23])

Recently, Dakota has pushed deeper into analytics with a **private fund performance & benchmarking dataset covering 14,000+ funds** (announced Nov 2025), signaling a move closer to Preqin/eVestment’s lane. ([Morningstar][24])

### 5.2 What Dakota sells / who uses it

**Core offering**

* **Dakota Marketplace / Dakota Data**:

  * Verified institutional investors across pensions, endowments, foundations, RIAs, wealth managers, family offices, etc. ([Dakota][21])
  * Investor preferences, mandates, and contact details.
  * Media / educational content and training for fundraisers.

**Primary users**

* Sales and capital formation teams at asset managers of all sizes.
* Often used by smaller or mid‑market managers who need **“who to call”** lists and don’t want to pay for Preqin/PitchBook seats.

### 5.3 Why people love Dakota

* **Contacts that work**: perceived higher accuracy and freshness than generic B2B contact tools.
* **Fundraiser DNA**: messaging leans heavily on “we’re fundraisers too; we built this for ourselves first.” ([Dakota][22])
* **Price point**: tends to be cheaper per seat than the large databases, making it accessible to smaller managers and distribution teams.

### 5.4 Where Dakota falls short for our ICP

* **Static contact orientation**: tells you who to call, **not when or why now**.
* **Limited allocator voice**: doesn’t systematically capture IC discussions, CIO commentary, or consultant recommendations in context.
* Emerging performance dataset is still **early and narrower** versus Preqin/eVestment; still not real‑time.

**Mental model**

> *“Dakota is your address book. Osmosis is the trigger engine that tells you which names in that book are hot this week and gives you the quote to open with.”*

We position Osmosis as a **stack‑mate**: use Osmosis to prioritize Dakota lists and supercharge outreach.

## 6. Nasdaq eVestment: consultant‑grade institutional analytics

### 6.1 History & scale

* **Founded 2000** in Atlanta, initially focused on solving data gaps for institutional manager due diligence. ([PitchBook][25])
* Provides a **global database of institutional investment strategies** (traditional and alternatives), performance data, and analytics. ([EquityNet][26])
* **Nasdaq acquired eVestment for $705M in 2017**, citing its **more than 2,000 clients, including 92% of the top asset managers, 76% of top consulting firms, and 80% of the top 20 pension funds**. ([Nasdaq Investor Relations][4])
* In 2023, Nasdaq eVestment launched its **private‑markets data offering**, making it a multi‑asset platform for institutional investors. ([Nasdaq][27])

### 6.2 What eVestment sells / who uses it

**Core offering**

* **eVestment Analytics / TopQ+**:

  * Strategy and vehicle‑level data for public and private strategies.
  * Benchmarks, peer groups, performance analytics, and due‑diligence tools. ([ILPA][28])

**Primary users**

* Asset owners (pensions, sovereigns, endowments).
* Investment consultants and OCIOs.
* Asset managers using it to understand how they screen vs. peers (and to align with consultant frameworks).

### 6.3 Why people love eVestment

* **Consultant alignment**: “the data that feeds the consultant and RFP world.”
* **Analytical depth**: strong on performance analytics and peer benchmarking.
* **Institutional ubiquity**: near‑universal usage by large asset owners and consultants.

### 6.4 Where eVestment falls short for our ICP

* **Not built for front‑line fundraisers**: it’s primarily a tool for analysts and consultants, not for RMs planning this week’s outreach.
* **Lagging signals**: by the time a pacing change or new sleeve shows up in eVestment‑driven consultant analysis, the **decision is already shaped.**
* **No voice‑of‑allocator layer**: again, it’s about reported performance and exposures, not what was just said in the IC.

**Mental model**

> *“eVestment is the rulebook consultants use. Osmosis tells you when allocators are thinking about changing the rules.”*

## 7. How the world sees these competitors (summary map)

Here’s a shorthand your team can keep in their heads:

| Player          | Mental tagline                            | Best at                                        | Weak for our buyer                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Preqin**      | “Home of alternatives”                    | Global alt data & benchmarks                   | Timing, voice, workflows            |

## 8. Osmosis: Our Positioning in This Landscape (Dec 2025)

### 8.1 Buyer’s problem (reframed in this context)

Your buyers—Heads of IR, Distribution, Capital Formation—win by **maximizing time in front of the right allocators** and minimizing:

1. **Research drag**

   * “Who should we be selling to?” means hours in Preqin, PitchBook, eVestment, minutes, consultants’ notes, and internal spreadsheets.

2. **Meeting prep overhead**

   * “How should we be selling to them?” means combing through PDFs and decks to guess what’s top‑of‑mind for the CIO and board.

3. **Internal defense & storytelling**

   * COOs and PMs ask: “Why aren’t we in more finals?” or “Which mandates did we miss?”
   * Without hard, time‑stamped data, IR teams get blamed for being “late” or “out of the flow.”

4. **Competitive ambiguity**

   * No clean view into **who else is in the room**, how often they’re mentioned, and what angles they’re winning with.

Legacy tools each chip away at parts of this, but they **all share three limitations**:

* They **don’t capture the real conversations** where pacing, policy, and manager preferences are actually shaped.
* They operate on **monthly/quarterly cadences**, not hours.
* They are **data stores**, not **agentic workflows** that automate the high‑value, repetitive tasks associates grind on.

### 8.2 What Osmosis actually does

From your own internal definition:

* **Capture**: We attend and ingest **allocator meetings, interviews, and filings in real time**—ICs, board meetings, hearings, CIO/consultant remarks, plus related documents.
* **Detect**: Our AI stack detects mandates, pacing changes, policy shifts, consultant recommendations, and competitive mentions from that stream.
* **Attribute & map**:

  * Every quote is **speaker‑attributed** (CIO vs consultant vs trustee/staff).
  * Our **knowledge graph** maps relationships and influence networks across plans, consultants, and managers. 
* **Automate**:

  * Personalized **watchlists** by plan/strategy/check size.
  * **Hourly alerts** and **daily/weekly digests** with “who to call, why, what to say.”
  * Agentic workflows that auto‑assemble meeting prep packs, trip plans, and prioritized outreach lists for associates.

Coverage:

* **20K allocators** representing **$15T in capital movements** across tens of thousands of conversations and documents, including **4,000+ allocator meetings across 360 public plans**, generating **~160 opportunities/month**.

### 8.3 The value, by persona

From your messaging, customized to fit this competitive frame:

* **Buyer (Head of IR / Capital Formation)**

  * **Supercharge associates**: 10 hours/week saved on research and prep = **$25K/year in efficiency per associate** (assuming $100K comp).
  * **Raise more money, faster**: customers consistently source **$100M+ tickets**; at 1% fees and 5‑year duration, that’s **$5M per win**.
  * **Build internal/external credibility** with data‑driven answers: “Here’s the clip from last week’s IC where they said X; here’s who we called and what happened.”

* **User (Associate / RM / Analyst)**

  * **Wow your boss**: show up with deeper, fresher allocator intel than anyone else in the room.
  * **Move faster on high‑value tasks**: meeting prep, lead identification, industry analysis, trip planning.
  * **Go deeper**: search across thousands of meetings and interviews to understand how a plan thinks about your strategy.

* **Approver (COO, CIO, Head of Distribution)**

  * A concrete “**this is how we’re using AI to separate from the pack**” story.
  * **Optionality on headcount**: use Osmosis to **turbo‑charge associates** or **free up headcount** for other initiatives.

### 8.4 Category & differentiation language (for your team)

You already have strong articulation; here’s a condensed version for this primer:

* **Category**: **Real‑Time Allocator Intelligence** (from disappearing data → actionable mandate signals).
* **Positioning sentence**:

  > For Sales and IR leaders who win by being first, Osmosis captures allocator conversations, attributes every quote to the person who said it, and maps the consultant + board networks behind each decision—so your team sees the flow of capital before competitors.
* **Tagline**:

  * Primary: **“The mathematics of being first.”**
  * Supporting: **“Databases are libraries. Osmosis is your radar.”**

**Key differentiators vs competitors**

1. **Time‑to‑signal**

   * Legacy: database updates and write‑ups arrive weeks/months later.
   * Osmosis: alerts **within hours** of meetings, hearings, and comments.

2. **Signal type**

   * Legacy: **retrospective** events (commitments, fund closings, performance).
   * Osmosis: **predictive** cues (pacing shifts, policy motions, upcoming searches, emerging manager programs).

3. **Data modality**

   * Legacy: rows in a database, PDF reports, and curated articles.
   * Osmosis: **voice, transcripts, and documents** tied to speakers and mapped across a knowledge graph.

4. **Actionability**

   * Legacy: “Here’s the market.”
   * Osmosis: “Here are the **3 allocators** talking about your strategy this week, what they said, who influences them, and a talk track you can use.”

5. **Workflow fit**

   * Legacy: research analysts & strategy teams.
   * Osmosis: **front‑line sellers, associates, and IR pros**, via alerts, prep packs, CRM‑ready workflows, and digests.

### 8.5 Why we win vs each major competitor

**Against Preqin**

* Use line: “Preqin tells you **who manages $10B**. Osmosis tells you **who’s deploying $500M next quarter** and what they said about your strategy yesterday.” 
* We **never** ask them to rip out Preqin; we position as **pipeline creation** vs. Preqin’s **reference library**.

**Against PitchBook**

* Use line: “PitchBook tracks companies and funds; Osmosis tracks **allocators and their conversations**.”
* We highlight **voice capture + knowledge graph + workflows**, which PitchBook doesn’t offer today.

**Against With Intelligence**

* Use line: “Context is useful. Winning is about **timing + action**.” 
* They should keep With Intelligence for editorial and events; **Osmosis is how they operationalize today’s allocator conversations.**

**Against Dakota**

* Use line: “Great—you know **who** to call. Osmosis tells you **when and why** to call.” 
* We slot in as a **prioritization engine** for Dakota lists, turning static coverage into live, intent‑driven outreach.

**Against eVestment**

* Use line: “Benchmarking is table stakes. Osmosis alerts **before** the benchmark changes, so you can shape the line‑up.” 
* Position Osmosis as the **pre‑RFP, pre‑consultant‑memo** signal.

### 8.6 Updated Osmosis SWOT (as of Dec 2025, vs current landscape)

**Strengths**

* **Unique dataset**: real‑time capture of allocator conversations (ICs, boards, CIO/consultant remarks) that no competitor systematically owns.
* **AI‑native stack**: designed from day one to extract structure from unstructured audio/text and push it into workflows, not just dashboards. 
* **Clear ROI & proof points**:

  * ~**20% presentation hit rate vs ~5% industry norm.**
  * Users regularly source **$100M+ mandates**; one such win ≈ **1,000×** annual platform cost.
* **Category clarity**: a crisp “library vs radar” story that resonates with buyers already paying for Preqin, PitchBook, Dakota, eVestment, and With Intelligence.

**Weaknesses**

* **Brand maturity**: compared to Preqin, PitchBook, and S&P/Nasdaq‑backed assets, Osmosis is still an **emerging brand**.
* **Coverage expectations**: some allocators don’t publish or record; our coverage mirrors **public source reality**, which means there are natural gaps outside of US public plans and more transparent bodies. 
* **“Build vs buy” skepticism**: larger managers with internal data teams may think they can DIY parts of what we do.

**Opportunities**

* **Market consolidation = whitespace**: as BlackRock, S&P, and Nasdaq roll up data libraries, there is a **clear opening for an independent, allocator‑voice‑native signal engine**. ([Q4 Capital][5])
* **Expansion of coverage**: beyond US public plans into endowments, foundations, SWFs, and international allocators wherever public discourse exists (recorded meetings, published interviews, public reports). 
* **Deeper workflow integrations**: CRM, sales engagement platforms, RevOps pipelines—moving from “alerts + prep packs” to fully integrated **agentic workflows**.

**Threats**

* **Incumbents moving “faster”**: Preqin, PitchBook, or S&P/With Intelligence may market “real‑time updates” or “live intelligence,” even if they’re still not truly capturing allocator voice.
* **New AI entrants**: alt‑data and AI startups targeting allocator transcripts, especially as more meetings are streamed or transcribed.

Mitigation story for the team:

* Real‑time allocator intelligence is **not just a latency claim**; it’s about:

  * Being **in the room** (capture).
  * Getting **speaker attribution and semantics right** (accuracy).
  * Turning that into **who/why/when workflows** (actionability).
* That requires full‑stack product + ops, not a UI feature bolted to an old database.

## 9. Bringing It Home for the Team

If you want everyone aligned on a simple mental model, it’s this:

1. **The giants (BlackRock/Preqin, S&P/With Intelligence, Nasdaq/eVestment, Morningstar/PitchBook) are consolidating the library layer.**
2. **Dakota and peers are racing to be the most accurate address book.**
3. **No one else owns the allocator voice in real time and routes it directly into seller workflows. That’s Osmosis.**

So when someone inside asks, “Where do we sit in this world?” the clean answer is:

> *“We’re not trying to be a bigger database than Preqin or PitchBook. We’re the real‑time allocator radar that makes those databases—and your sales team—more powerful. We capture what was said in the meeting, map who actually matters, and turn that into ‘who to call, why now, and what to say’ within hours.”*

You can then plug in all your existing playbook assets (battle cards, email templates, sequences, ROI math) on top of this narrative.
